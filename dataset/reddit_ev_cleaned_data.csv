electricvehicles,Thoughts on Automakers having control over your vehicle?,"There has been a recent uproar regarding Zeekr EVs with the company threatening to ""brick"" vehicles imported and not purchased from local authorized dealers (ADs). To refuse warranty and or service is one thing, but to ""brick"" the vehicle is just plain outrageous.

What are your general thoughts on automakers having control over your vehicle and having the ability to disable your infotainment system, reducing engine power, stopping the vehicle from charging, or not letting the vehicle start all together. There have been rumours of this happening to Zeekr owners in Russia and now more recently Zeekr has publicly threatened owners in Egypt for not purchasing their cars through ADs. (Link to post: https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1F6tc54Uh6/)

Where do we draw the line of customer convenience and invasion of privacy and consumer property breach? What is to say that a company like Zeekr will not ""control"" or ""disable"" my vehicle later on even if I buy it from an AD. If they have the power to do it, how do we trust them with it? Who's to say they won't threaten to ""disable"" a car if they don't like the customer?

Too many questions, not many answers.

electricvehicles,Applegreen Charging Rates & Grok Misinformation,"Quite a few people across multiple social media sites have been spreading misinformation (more likely disinformation) about the cost of Applegreen *especially* since the NJ-Tesla news came out... 

States have been copy-pasting EV rules for a minute and it seems NJ is setting a new precedent that will cascade... which is amazing news:

** The cost is $0.35 at most Applegreen locations in NJ. **

 In my experience, Connecticut is a little more expensive. Around 0.55, the cost I usually see at Tesla Superchargers. 

 BUT. When you Google it, the top result is from X (Elon-owned) and the information itself is from Grok (also Elon), and claims it to be between 0.64/kwh and 0.84.

Just wanted to inform yall that it's not, even for 350kW chargers. 

It's interesting this misinformation is coming out right after the NJ article was published, too. 

It was also brought to my attention that Tesla put out a statement on the matter and is also lying about costs.

Just letting yall know it's great for EV owners. We finally have universally cheaper-than-gas prices after all! And a reminder than no one is immune to disinformation.

electricvehicles,Damage to battery on EV stored in hot climate,"I am considering either a BEV or a PHEV.  It will be kept in the Palm Springs CA area in a garage.

electricvehicles,British Columbia road trip report,"Just back from a 1,000+ mile road trip from Bellingham Washington through southern BC. We have a 2025 Kia EV9 Wind with a range of about 300 or so miles. Our first charger stop in Merritt BC and it was our only wait. We spent the time chatting with all the other people there because it was everyone's first EV road trip and we got to see the VW Buzz up close. 

The charging system in that region is excellent. Flo, BC Hydro, Electrify Canada, and a convenience store system - we used them all. Several required a different app, which was the only hassle. A few of the chargers are a bit slow but the timing generally worked out for us to have lunch or dinner near the charger for an hour. There was never anyone waiting for us. There are even chargers (albeit slow ones) at some of the rest stops. 

My husband LOVES road trips and I have a touchy back so I never wanted to go very far in our old ICE cars. But this was a really pleasant trip in a super comfortable car. We had some anxiety before we left about range/charging but we found plenty of chargers, even in more remote areas such as Arrow Lakes and south of Golden.

electricvehicles,Why do people use non Tesla chargers when Tesla chargers are nearby,"This question in not about the recent hysteria about Tesla.

There's a charging site I use in the UK which has a row of Tesla superchargers opposite a row of non Tesla chargers. The Tesla ones are open to non Tesla's and cost about 40% less per Kwh.

But as I sit there in my non Tesla enjoying my fast cheap charge there is a steady stream of EVs using the more expensive ones opposite despite plenty of free spaces on the Tesla side.

I repeat...this question is just about why people do this....and did this long before the recent negative press etc about Tesla and its owner. 

And it's not just one or two cars choosing the non Tesla side...I'd say it's 50% of them.

electricvehicles,Not having your own garage/driveway/charger,"Hey,

Looking to get my first EV, but as the title says, I won’t have the ability to charge at home.

I’d like to hear from other apartment dwellers who went EV despite having to rely on public chargers.

I live in the Netherlands and my neighbourhood, like most these days, does have a few scattered public chargers. Including one in a row of public parking spots I use anyway.

There’s a limited number of chargers at my work as well, but these are often in use.

The main issue near my home is that there is a shortage of parking spaces and I often see petrol cars using the spaces that should be reserved for EVs wanting to use the chargers.

Also, I know these aren’t as cheap as having your own home charging solution, especially if you have solar panels. But is the difference prohibitive?

At the moment I don’t really see a big issue. I don’t have a petrol pump at home for my petrol car either, after all. I might have to walk a little further if the nearest public charger is not available, but I can just move my car closer after the four hours it takes to charge it.

electricvehicles,Rarer than a Bugatti Chiron - AZD Transit Connect,"I managed to come across and buy this 1 of \~500 electric Transit Connect off a friend of a friend 2 years ago as a project and spent some time fixing it up. It needed shocks, a wheel bearing, a steering rack, and some body work, but it's been on the road again for a little while now and definitely in much better shape mechanically and physically than when I acquired it. 

Gets about 50-60 miles of range depending on driving speed, and from near-empty a metered charger reported \~25 kWh inputted into the battery after charging losses, so overall not doing too shabby for degradation being an early-tech battery that's now 14 years old.

electricvehicles,5.000 kilometer road trip with a Kia Soul from Belgium to Sweden and back.,"Hello, been lurking this sub for a long time and I want to share my experience with an ""older"" EV. I bought my used Kia Soul 64kwh (2020) last year in october for a bargain price and promised my girlfriend way before that that we would visit Sweden sometime. 

So after I ditched my Dacia Dokker and got my new toy I decided it was time to make good on this promise. We departed 3 weeks ago, first trip from Antwerp to Munster, next stops included Hamburg, Copenhagen, Gotenburg, Norkoping, Stockholm, Simrishamn, back to Malmo, Hamburg and then home.

Average daily kilometers were around 350-400. This car could reach 400km but obviously not on a highway unless I drive behind a truck, so every trip I had to stop at least once. But honestly I liked it, I'm the only one with a driver's license so I enjoyed the 20 (or more) minute breaks. Most of our charging stops were combined with toilet breaks, lunch breaks,...never a dull moment.

I have used ABRP exactly once but it lacked options for toll roads, ferry,...I switched to google maps and could find charging stations with ease in Denmark and Sweden through the ""add stop"" function. Germany is a different beast, but we had only three nights in Germany. There's a vast difference in charging infrastructure between Sweden and Germany. 

We rented a lot of Airbnb's and lots of those included a charger which is kind of common around Sweden. I got to charge my car at night for free or a very low price which impacted the total cost of the trip. Driving was very comfortable in the EV and I only had range anxiety once. 

I noticed a lot of newer EV's charged waaaaay faster than my 55kwh max Kia soul, I didn't really mind my slower Soul, we weren't in a hurry.

electricvehicles,EV business model in the USA hopeless,"The current EV market in the USA right now is broken.

Resale values for EVs is very low and people are getting rid of these hot potato vehicles before they hit their warranty expiration.

Once these vehicles hit the used car market people are scared of touching them for fear of a huge $10-$20k new high voltage battery bill.

The proponents of the current status quo say everything is Ok the risk of battery failure is overstated with links to mickey mouse studies saying how great the batteries are and how long they last.

The EV manufacturer warranties are pretty crappy, most are about 100,000 miles. I think Rivian has one that is 175,000 miles or so which is better.

The proponents say that 100,000 miles is the normal life of a gas engine so 100,000 is fine. I guess most of these people never owned gas cars for long because 200,000 miles is the new 100,000 mile limit people sort of set in their heads for expected life.  100,000 miles was probably a big deal in 60s or 70s but not anymore.

So if battery failures are so uncommon then why do I see videos with people having Teslas towed away for battery replacement or see posts with people posting invoices showing the battery cost? Companies can make the battery warranty 200,000 miles then if it is so uncommon.

The insurance companies will not cover the battery failures from my understanding and the one company that I found offering such coverage has only been doing so for a year or so and does not seem like a legitimate insurance company to me.

The aftermarket companies offering battery replacements I could not find any in my city. The closest thing I found is some places like Ebay selling used batteries and some other place selling refurbished batteries so not the most reassuring.

So basically until the car manufacturers solve this issue, people are gonna be trading in their 4 yr old EVs like they trade in iPhone for new model and the old cars will probably be sent to the third world for scrap metal or recycling.

Anyways that is my opinion.

electricvehicles,Corsa-e DC charging issue,"Hi all. I have a 2021 Vauxhall Corsa-e with about 30,000 miles on it. Last year while on a long trip to Dorset on about 3 separate occasions at separate ultra-rapid charge points my car would stop charging after receiving about 30-50 miles range. The car would show charging complete but the charger would show that it's still charging but at 0 KWh or that it was connecting to vehicle. Not really a big deal at the time and I just tapped my card again and eventually got to enough charge to get home. I did another trip and used the same chargers about a month later with no issues and the car was receiving an impressive (for almost freezing weather) 70kwh. I never thought about it because I almost never use DC charging, I almost exclusively charge at home using my Ohme charger - which has only ever failed me once in well over a year for unknown reasons. 
I'm doing another big trip down south soon so practiced DC charging my car at a local Sainsbury's and this time it stayed stuck at initiating charge. My car was flashing green as if it was charging, and the dash had the charging display but wasn't charging. The charger itself just said initiating charge. It sat like this while I did my whole shopping. So now I'm a little nervous for my trip.

electricvehicles,Dealer claimed the $4k used EV rebate without a sale — now I can’t use it on the car I actually bought??,"So a few days ago, we were checking out a used EV at a dealership. The salesperson kind of pressured us into starting some paperwork, even though the car had just hit the lot and we didn’t even get to test drive it. We ended up not buying it and walked away.

We found a different car at another dealership and actually bought that one. But when they tried to submit the info for the $4,000 federal used EV tax credit, it got rejected — apparently because the credit had already been used. Turns out the first dealership submitted the claim to the IRS, even though we never bought the car.

We didn’t sign a purchase agreement or anything — just got talked into some early paperwork. It’s super frustrating, and now we can’t get the rebate for the car we actually purchased.

Has anyone run into this before? Is there a way to fix it or undo the first dealer’s submission? Should I be contacting the IRS, or pushing the first dealership to correct it?

Appreciate any advice!

Edit: the second car is single owner, definitely qualifies

electricvehicles,Efficiency drafting on motorway,"I often think when driving on the motorway is it more efficient for me to be driving at 65mph with no one in front of me or should I be keeping up with the speed of others, about 70-75mph and be drafting behind them, at a safe distance, with automatic cruise control of course. 

I couldn't find much on this topic but I did find this YouTube video where his tests find about 14.5% mi/KW gain on drafting a lorry (safe distance, automatic cruise control) https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Btd8-o2ALPU&pp=ygUZRXYgZHJhZnRpbmcgdGVzdCBtb3RvcndhedIHCQmwCQGHKiGM7w%3D%3D

AI then suggests a 5-10% efficieny loss moving up 65 to 70mph and then again 5-10% 70-75pm. 

This suggests that it's potentially more efficient to drive at 70mph if that means keeping up with the flow of traffic and getting the benefits of drafting Vs staying at 65mph with no cars in front of you.

Would be keen to hear your thoughts and whether you've seen any other tests done. Appreciate what I've done above is very rough.

Obviously not suggesting I'm looking to drive 2 feet behind someone to get max efficiency. No efficient gain is worth any drop in safety. I don't know what distance the guy in the above video was behind the lorry but it looked like quite a good distance, certainly more than you often get on English motorways!

Why are they charging over twice the amount because your vehicle is an ev? I get that evs have a lot of security features, and  heavier weight, but is it REALLY so different that they need to charge so much?? 

Other nearby places don't list an ev price online, but I'm sure they will try and overcharge me. I dont go on the highway anyway, so I can live with the shaking that happens only 60mph+, but it's not something I want to keep brushing under the rug. 

Which service centers have you guys gone to they wont try and charge me $200+ for a wheel alignment?

electricvehicles,$2.4K (US) quote to replace a single headlight on the VW ID.4 pro (component pricing are getting out of hand),"2.4k was from the dealership, includes 1.4k for a headlight assembly and 5 hours of labor (the whole bumper needs to come off)

I found a third party site that sells the part for ~$600 and a shop that will install it for $350, but that’s still $1k to fix a single led strip. 

The ID.4 has an intregrated LED light bar in the headlight assembly. There is no way to shut it off while driving, it is always on. 

My drivers side just failed, normal headlights work fine. 

They can’t just replace the daytime running light, they can only replace the whole headlight assembly. 

This wouldn’t be (as big of) an issue if I could just turn off my daytime runners, but on the ID.4, there is NO option for this. 

So now I’m forced to pay $2400 through VW or $1000 through a third party just so my car is aesthetically pleasing (One daytime headlight not ALWAYS out). Which also may put the car on a cops radar as well to let me know I have a headlight out. But that’s just anxiety.

I’m just curious, anyone else facing these hard to swallow prices for what should be cheap, easily replaceable tech/components? This isn’t even the matrix headlights. Just standard…

It’s crazy to think that If I needed both headlights replaced on an ID.4, I’m looking at $~4,000 (from VW), almost 1/10th of the cars total original value. 


I’m just in complete shock with this

electricvehicles,New vehicle purchase - check my gas/kWh math please,"TLDR: upgrading from a 35mpg (city) 2nd gen Prius to PHEV or EV, think either one will save us in the long run as gasoline costs increase here in California, but based on my math it is not looking feasible. I need some input if my math needs to account for other factors. 

For context, my wife has a 2007 Prius that's reliable but showing its age. Haven't done much highway driving lately but have been tracking the last few fuel purchases of mostly city driving and it seems to be getting about 35mpg lately. Regular 87 octane is holding at around $4/gallon. So approx 11.4 cents per mile for fuel only (not including maintenance, etc).
Central Valley CA. We are expected to see gas in the $6-8 range within the next 2 years due to refineries shutting down permanently, unless there is some course correction with the political winds.

Our goal in a new vehicle is to upgrade from what we currently have and have a vehicle that is good for long trips. We think PHEV is the ideal candidate. It would allow efficient daily commute use, but still have the engine and tank to take us anywhere on longer trips like we currently use her car or my truck (400-500 mile range) without having to deal with the range anxiety or charging times of a full EV. 

I'm learning to look past the MPGe number and look more closely at the specs, since MPGe is an average formula based on average driver use case scenario. 
Learning to ask: what is the MPG of the gas powertrain that will take us on longer trips, and what is the kWh/100 mile number.

Example a new Kia Sorento or Sportage PHEV have 31/34 miles of EV range respectively, and approx 34-36mpg gas, but a Mazda CX90 has 26 miles of battery range and only gets 26mpg gas. These are just a few PHEV models we have considered. 
Digging deeper, the kWh/100 mile ratings:
Kia Sportage PHEV 40
Kia Sorento PHEV 45
Mazda CX-90 PHEV 58

We do not currently have solar, it is in the future plans, so for now just paying straight PG&E rates on a tiered rate plan. Obviously since we regularly use the allocation and dip into Tier 2 most months, any home EV charging above our current usage would be billed as Tier 2 rates (currently $0.51/kWh). That means the above vehicles would cost 20, 23, or 30 cents per mile for their EV-only powertrain. Which is way more than we currently pay for gasoline so on paper it doesn't appear to pan out. 

However, it appears to have any benefit, you need to structure your life around a specific time-of-use rate plan, geared for EVs. The simplest one is basically allowing 12am-3pm (overnight and all day) charging at a reduced rate of $0.31/kWh. 3-4pm and 9pm-12 is the same $0.51 as current T2, and 4pm-9pm is $0.62 as a ""penalty"" for using during peak hours. (Yes, for all of you paying $0.10 or less per kWh on average in other states, that is what we have to deal with here)

That brings me to the new math of $0.31/kwh x 40kwh/100 miles = 12.4 cents per mile (for Kia Sportage PHEV), 14 for Sorento, and 18 cents for CX-90.
Until gasoline prices shoot up here, the PHEV doesn't look any better on paper. 

As a side note, even though we don't want to deal with range anxiety, we notice regular EVs tend to have a far better efficiency rating in this sense. A Tesla Y is 27kWh/100 miles, meaning (at this special PG&E rate plan) our total cost for home charging would be 8.4 cents per mile. 

Is there other math I need to consider in this? 
Are different chargers more or less efficient than others?
Would Level 1 or Level 2 charging have a drastically different $/kwh effect on our energy bill?
Do the mpge and kWh/100mi ratings on the vehicles mean little, do they get better or worse field results?

electricvehicles,Any solution for a faster charge at home without a rewire?,"We got an electrician over today to look at our wiring. Our house is from 1962 and still has its original panel in the bedroom, currently at its max load. 

Apparently it only supports 80 Amps, so the only way I'm getting even a level 2 charger outside is with a panel upgrade, which will cost $10k. 

Any ideas? I guess if I have to scoot by with 1.6kw L1, I can do it, but I was really hoping to upgrade even a bit.

electricvehicles,First-Time EV Buyer's Guide,"I often help people on the weekly General Questions and Purchasing Advice thread, and have been thinking about doing something like this to compile my answers to common questions. I'm going to structure it like a guide for each part of the buying process, but it's more like a collection of my thoughts. I'd be happy to add to it if anyone has anything else to contribute! This is also US-centric (sorry). 

#The Starting Line
So you want to buy an EV eh? Awesome! The process is, in general, very similar to buying a standard internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, but with a few key additional areas of research. I'm going to assume you generally know the basics of ICE vehicle ownership, and make this guide as specific as possible the electric portion of the vehicle purchasing. 

Let me say this up top though if you are on the fence for an EV. If you can charge at home and have a two-car (or more) household, you 100% should make one of those cars an EV. You'll save money on gas and oil changes, and experience the convenience of leaving home with a full ""tank"" every morning. You can get a used Chevy Bolt or Tesla for less than $10k almost anywhere in the US if you qualify for the $4k tax credit, and they're great vehicles that can completely cover 99% of driving needs (and obviously there's plenty of vehicles at higher prices). If that's all you need to hear, go for it. 

# Assess your situation
As always you should buy a car that suits your needs. Trucks for construction work, vans for families, etc. EVs are no different, but you should ask yourself a few additional questions to determine which, if any, EV is right for you: 

* The first, most important question - do you have a place to charge? The main benefit EV owners cite is that the vehicle can ""refuel"" at home, every night. In contrast, the ""worst"" part of the experience is public charging. Even for Superchargers, which are widely considered the most reliable and easiest to use network, charging takes longer than refueling with gas and almost always eliminates any cost savings from getting rid of gas. It's less common, but you can also 100% get by if you charge at work or a public area like a shopping center you regularly visit. 
* What's your normal daily mileage? How much battery do you need? Almost all full battery-powered EVs (BEVs) have >200 miles of range at this point. You could even look at plug-in hybrid EV (PHEVs) if you fit the specific use-case for it (short daily use, home charging, and regular longer road trips) although having a more complex vehicle that retains all the maintenance of a gas engine is, for many, too much of a drawback when BEVs are becoming so capable. 
* Do you plan to use this vehicle to regularly travel to a certain destination more than 100 miles away? Like a weekend ski trip or family in another state? You can use apps like plugshare or A Better Route Planner (ABRP) to plot out these trips and see what public charging is available. Almost nowhere in the US is completely inaccessible to EVs anymore, but some places are much less convenient. 
* Another way to ask the previous question is: do you have another vehicle in your household? A gas vehicle is, in 99% of cases, indisputably better for long distance travel compared to an EV. If you decide that your vehicle will only ever charge at home (outside of emergencies), you can completely ignore fast charging rates, which are relatively difficult to research and understand. 
* There are [calculators](https://afdc.energy.gov/calc/) online to [determine](https://chooseev.com/savings-calculator/) how much [you'll save](https://chargevc.org/ev-calculator/) on fuel by switching to electric. It obviously depends heavily on your particular situation, but rule of thumb is (assuming you charge at home) you'll spend 1/3 of what you spent on gas ($1500 in a year -> $500 in a year), and you'll have minimal maintenance costs. I will say that if money is very tight, you'll find the best value in optimizing your purchase for your needs. A used Bolt, Leaf, or eGolf from the late 2010s won't have the range or charging speed of a Model 3 or Ioniq, but could save you a bunch of money if you just need to go from your garage to work every day. (/u/nzahn1 provided [additional recommendations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kxu7oq/firsttime_ev_buyers_guide/muwjzjg/))

# Do your research
Once you have a handle on your needs (miles of range, fast charging needs, etc.) you can start to actually look into cars. If you are new to EVs, you should contact a dealer and test drive one, ASAP. Doesn't even matter what kind, just go and try it. You'll never forget the first time you put the pedal to the floor in a Hyundai and it accelerates like a Porsche.  

Obviously, you'll have your own price range and vehicle preferences, but here's what you should know about the electric side of things. I would recommend starting with a filter for range and price, and survey which vehicles are in your budget that meet your needs. Give yourself a shortlist and then start to think about your particular use case, considering the following: 


* Maximum fast charging speed (sometimes called DCFC speed): Ignore this if you only plan on charging at home, because it determines your maximum speed at a fast charger. Usually given in kilowatts (kW) or alternatively described by ""10% to 80% charge time"", this is the *peak* charging rate. A number of 50 kW is almost unbearably low (60+ minutes to recharge), while 150 is solid and 200+ is as fast as they come (<20 minutes to recharge). This stat is not standardized so it has to be individually researched for each model you're interested in, and it's worth keeping in mind that it's a *maximum* value, which is affected by things like temperature and how many other people are charging. One thing that might be helpful is to go on PlugShare and check out the specific charging stations you expect to use. The app encourages ""check-ins"" from real users where they report their vehicle information as well as how their charge went. 

* ""Fuel"" efficiency: For ICE vehicles, miles per gallon (MPG) is a useful metric for showing the cost of running the vehicle. It's somewhat less important for EVs because electricity is generally cheaper than gas, but can be valuable information to know. Unfortunately, there are 3 metrics for this in EVs right now that all represent the same thing. Here's the short version: MPGe is an attempt to bridge the gap between gas and electric, so the raw number is mostly meaningless for anything besides comparison. Bigger number is better, typically above 100 MPGe. Miles per kilowatt-hour (mi/kWh) is my favorite, since it's just miles/gallon but swapped to the common unit for electric energy. Bigger is better, and numbers range from ~2 for trucks and go up to ~5 for efficient sedans. You can invert it and get kWh/mi, and since this is a decimal it's often shown as kWh/100 miles. For this, *smaller* is better, and numbers range from 20 to 50. Vehicle-specific subreddits are usually a good source of people reporting their numbers, although be aware that people tend to self-report their good numbers more than their bad ones. 

* Understand what the ""range"" number means practically: EVs are more efficient in the city than on the highway, by a significant margin. This is because EVs are more affected by aerodynamics, and going faster will steadily eat into your range. Most ""highway range"" numbers are given for fairly conservative speeds of 65-70 mph, so if you want to go 80, you'll shrink your range (conversely, EV drivers will commonly ""extend"" their range if needed by simply going slower). Electric motors and batteries also get less efficient in the cold, by like 20-30%. Combined, this means that a car with 300 miles of advertised range will get an absolute maximum of ~200 miles of range in cold weather, and that's if you're charging to 100% and driving it down to 0%. Rain, wind, and snow are also killers for aerodynamic reasons. Good practice is to just cut the advertised number in half if you plan to do winter road trips and want to know the most reliable, practical range. Elevation and weather are also usually important. I recommend finding YouTube ""range tests"" of the type of car you want. There are tons of these online. 

* Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability: This is worth a mention basically because of Tesla, although other automakers are starting to offer some functionality, and the EV customer base makes for a good ""early adopter"" test market. It can be a very attractive feature, especially if you do a lot of driving. For reviews, I would watch some videos on your specific model or go to the vehicle-specific subreddit and ask around. This one is also really important to evaluate in a test drive. 

* Plug type: This is last because it's less important, since adapters exist, but you should know if the vehicle you want uses the NACS (also known as SAE J3400) or CCS plug type (SAE J1772). In the US in 2023, Tesla convinced everyone to adopt theirs as standard, which definitely won't be annoying for anyone. Starting in 2025, many new vehicles will be releasing with this plug type, and from 2026 on, most manufacturers that I'm aware of have committed to it exclusively (within the US). If you see a ""CHAdeMO"" plug type, run away; CHAdeMO isn't real, it can't hurt you. ^^Just ^^kidding ^^the ^^Leaf ^^is ^^fine, ^^just ^^kind ^^of ^^outdated ^^at ^^this ^^point. 

# How to charge

During your vehicle research process, you should also, in parallel, determine how you're going to charge at home. You may already be aware of the different ""levels"": Level 1 charging is a basic wall outlet, Level 2 usually has a dedicated breaker and is basically a high voltage/amperage outlet, like you would get for industrial equipment. Level 3 is DC charging, and these are exclusively for public charging. To give some loose numbers, in order to add 50 miles of range, Level 1 takes 10-15 hours, Level 2 takes 2-5 hours, and level 3 takes less than an hour. 

**Many people can get by with basic level 1 charging, and do not need to spend ~$1000 on installing level 2 charging in their home**. Evaluate your daily driving, and how long your vehicle is parked at home. You still might want level 2 charging if you do anything that adds big spikes of driving into your schedule. It sucks to get back from a road trip and stress that you won't be charged enough to get to work the next day, or to leave for a road trip and *not* be at 100% because you charged too slow. 

If your garage doesn't have electric hookups or your breaker box is in a weird spot in your basement or something, it will become quite expensive to install level 2 charging. Usually, it costs something like $400 for the hardware itself and $200-800 for basic installation. If you want specifics on which chargers are good, consult /r/evcharging. If nothing else, know that you need to ensure your equipment meets certain safety specs, so look for UL or ETL standards under product specs. 

Edit: Also, as /u/IM_Oscar_dot_com said, many states and/or utility companies offer incentives to help you set up charging stations in your home. See if you qualify before installation! 

# Making the purchase
Once you've drilled down on the vehicle you want, there's a few additional considerations that happen when you've fully locked in on the car you want and are ready to buy. 

* Tax credits: Although not relevant after Dec. 31 2025, [there are currently federal credits for EVs](https://www.irs.gov/clean-vehicle-tax-credits), both new and used. Read the link if interested, but the three big things you should know are: 1) there are requirements on your income and the vehicle price, 2) There's some other requirements based on the vehicle model year (if used) or country it was manufactured in (if new), and 3) for new vehicles there's a ""lease loophole"" that's fairly easy to take advantage of. Everyone's case is different, so just ask if you have more questions here. Lastly, be careful when shopping, since some dealers will incorporate the tax cut into the advertised price (assuming you qualify for the income requirements), while some do not. 

* General trends with EV sales (May, 2025): The big thing right now is that depreciation on EVs is relatively high compared to the rest of the car market (and doubly so for Teslas). Importantly, this is not for technical reasons. EV [battery degradation is minimal](https://www.geotab.com/blog/ev-battery-health/), electric motors are theoretically more reliable than gas with fewer moving parts, and 94% of people who have an EV plan to stay with EVs. However, EVs still occupy a bit of an ""early adopter"" niche, so the people who want them are more likely to buy new. Long story short - lease or buy a gently used vehicle for the best bang for your buck. But, like, I'm not your dad or anything, do what you want. 

* Test drive: Do not buy your first EV without a significant test drive. If you've done your research well, you'll likely know more about the vehicle than the sales rep. Try out different levels of regenerative braking. Sit with the tech interface for a bit, and see if anything pops out as annoying. Try the self-driving. If there are different drive modes, give them a test. Most people dislike one-pedal driving at first but fall in love with it later, so just leave that off if you can. Also, after driving it for 10-15 minutes, look at what the range is projecting and the current battery percentage. Use those numbers to get the range at 100%, and see how that stacks up with your expectations. This isn't 100% reliable, but it can be used for a quick check. 

#Common courtesies

/u/polymath-nc made a good point about EV common courtesy things. Like at a busy gas station, it's polite to move your car as soon as its done pumping. For EVs, there's a few other things that might not be obvious to you: 

* Don't charge to 100% at a DCFC charger, especially if there are others waiting. They slow down dramatically as the car approaches 100%, so you're just you're just wasting everyone's time (including yourself!). It's always going to be faster to drive down to <10% and then charge until the charging slows down (usually ~80%). 

* If you have a relatively slow charging vehicle (Bolt is a common example with a max speed of 50 kW), you should be considerate when using fast chargers. If you have a choice between a 100 kW charger and a 350 kW charger, it won't make any difference to you which you use, while an Ioniq will take twice as long to charge at the 100 kW charger. 

* CHAdeMO plugs are relatively rare and often included as a second cable on a CCS charger. If you've got a CCS/NACS vehicle, treat it like the handicapped stall in the bathroom (they are using CHAdeMO after all), where you should use it only if the other chargers are full. 

* Many Supercharger stations have short cords because they were optimized for Teslas, meaning that non-Teslas might have to take up two spaces to connect to their vehicle. If they can (again, handicapped stall logic), Tesla users should leave the end spots open to minimize this, and non-Tesla users should use those end spots rather than take up two spaces.

Most ""highway range"" numbers are given for fairly conservative speeds of 65-70 mph, so if you want to go 80, you'll shrink your range (conversely, EV drivers will commonly ""extend"" their range if needed by simply going slower). Electric motors and batteries also get less efficient in the cold, by like 20-30%. Combined, this means that a car with 300 miles of advertised range will get an absolute maximum of ~200 miles of range in cold weather, and that's if you're charging to 100% and driving it down to 0%. Rain, wind, and snow are also killers for aerodynamic reasons. Good practice is to just cut the advertised number in half if you plan to do winter road trips and want to know the most reliable, practical range. Elevation and weather are also usually important. I recommend finding YouTube ""range tests"" of the type of car you want. There are tons of these online. 

* Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability: This is worth a mention basically because of Tesla, although other automakers are starting to offer some functionality, and the EV customer base makes for a good ""early adopter"" test market. It can be a very attractive feature, especially if you do a lot of driving. For reviews, I would watch some videos on your specific model or go to the vehicle-specific subreddit and ask around. This one is also really important to evaluate in a test drive. 

* Plug type: This is last because it's less important, since adapters exist, but you should know if the vehicle you want uses the NACS (also known as SAE J3400) or CCS plug type (SAE J1772). In the US in 2023, Tesla convinced everyone to adopt theirs as standard, which definitely won't be annoying for anyone. Starting in 2025, many new vehicles will be releasing with this plug type, and from 2026 on, most manufacturers that I'm aware of have committed to it exclusively (within the US). If you see a ""CHAdeMO"" plug type, run away; CHAdeMO isn't real, it can't hurt you. ^^Just ^^kidding ^^the ^^Leaf ^^is ^^fine, ^^just ^^kind ^^of ^^outdated ^^at ^^this ^^point. 

# How to charge

During your vehicle research process, you should also, in parallel, determine how you're going to charge at home. You may already be aware of the different ""levels"": Level 1 charging is a basic wall outlet, Level 2 usually has a dedicated breaker and is basically a high voltage/amperage outlet, like you would get for industrial equipment. Level 3 is DC charging, and these are exclusively for public charging. To give some loose numbers, in order to add 50 miles of range, Level 1 takes 10-15 hours, Level 2 takes 2-5 hours, and level 3 takes less than an hour. 

**Many people can get by with basic level 1 charging, and do not need to spend ~$1000 on installing level 2 charging in their home**. Evaluate your daily driving, and how long your vehicle is parked at home. You still might want level 2 charging if you do anything that adds big spikes of driving into your schedule. It sucks to get back from a road trip and stress that you won't be charged enough to get to work the next day, or to leave for a road trip and *not* be at 100% because you charged too slow. 

If your garage doesn't have electric hookups or your breaker box is in a weird spot in your basement or something, it will become quite expensive to install level 2 charging. Usually, it costs something like $400 for the hardware itself and $200-800 for basic installation. If you want specifics on which chargers are good, consult /r/evcharging. If nothing else, know that you need to ensure your equipment meets certain safety specs, so look for UL or ETL standards under product specs. 

Edit: Also, as /u/IM_Oscar_dot_com said, many states and/or utility companies offer incentives to help you set up charging stations in your home. See if you qualify before installation! 

# Making the purchase
Once you've drilled down on the vehicle you want, there's a few additional considerations that happen when you've fully locked in on the car you want and are ready to buy. 

* Tax credits: Although not relevant after Dec. 31 2025, [there are currently federal credits for EVs](https://www.irs.gov/clean-vehicle-tax-credits), both new and used. Read the link if interested, but the three big things you should know are: 1) there are requirements on your income and the vehicle price, 2) There's some other requirements based on the vehicle model year (if used) or country it was manufactured in (if new), and 3) for new vehicles there's a ""lease loophole"" that's fairly easy to take advantage of. Everyone's case is different, so just ask if you have more questions here. Lastly, be careful when shopping, since some dealers will incorporate the tax cut into the advertised price (assuming you qualify for the income requirements), while some do not. 

* General trends with EV sales (May, 2025): The big thing right now is that depreciation on EVs is relatively high compared to the rest of the car market (and doubly so for Teslas). Importantly, this is not for technical reasons. EV [battery degradation is minimal](https://www.geotab.com/blog/ev-battery-health/), electric motors are theoretically more reliable than gas with fewer moving parts, and 94% of people who have an EV plan to stay with EVs. However, EVs still occupy a bit of an ""early adopter"" niche, so the people who want them are more likely to buy new. Long story short - lease or buy a gently used vehicle for the best bang for your buck. But, like, I'm not your dad or anything, do what you want. 

* Test drive: Do not buy your first EV without a significant test drive. If you've done your research well, you'll likely know more about the vehicle than the sales rep. Try out different levels of regenerative braking. Sit with the tech interface for a bit, and see if anything pops out as annoying. Try the self-driving. If there are different drive modes, give them a test. Most people dislike one-pedal driving at first but fall in love with it later, so just leave that off if you can. Also, after driving it for 10-15 minutes, look at what the range is projecting and the current battery percentage. Use those numbers to get the range at 100%, and see how that stacks up with your expectations. This isn't 100% reliable, but it can be used for a quick check. 

#Common courtesies

/u/polymath-nc made a good point about EV common courtesy things. Like at a busy gas station, it's polite to move your car as soon as its done pumping. For EVs, there's a few other things that might not be obvious to you: 

* Don't charge to 100% at a DCFC charger, especially if there are others waiting. They slow down dramatically as the car approaches 100%, so you're just you're just wasting everyone's time (including yourself!). It's always going to be faster to drive down to <10% and then charge until the charging slows down (usually ~80%). 

* If you have a relatively slow charging vehicle (Bolt is a common example with a max speed of 50 kW), you should be considerate when using fast chargers. If you have a choice between a 100 kW charger and a 350 kW charger, it won't make any difference to you which you use, while an Ioniq will take twice as long to charge at the 100 kW charger. 

* CHAdeMO plugs are relatively rare and often included as a second cable on a CCS charger. If you've got a CCS/NACS vehicle, treat it like the handicapped stall in the bathroom (they are using CHAdeMO after all), where you should use it only if the other chargers are full. 

* Many Supercharger stations have short cords because they were optimized for Teslas, meaning that non-Teslas might have to take up two spaces to connect to their vehicle. If they can (again, handicapped stall logic), Tesla users should leave the end spots open to minimize this, and non-Tesla users should use those end spots rather than take up two spaces.

Edited in the first few comments. Thanks, and keep them coming!",firsttime ev buyers guide i often help people on the weekly general questions and purchasing advice thread and have been thinking about doing something like this to compile my answers to common questions im going to structure it like a guide for each part of the buying process but its more like a collection of my thoughts id be happy to add to it if anyone has anything else to contribute this is also uscentric sorry the starting line so you want to buy an ev eh awesome the process is in general very similar to buying a standard internal combustion engine ice vehicle but with a few key additional areas of research im going to assume you generally know the basics of ice vehicle ownership and make this guide as specific as possible the electric portion of the vehicle purchasing let me say this up top though if you are on the fence for an ev if you can charge at home and have a twocar or more household you 100 should make one of those cars an ev youll save money on gas and oil changes and experience the convenience of leaving home with a full tank every morning you can get a used chevy bolt or tesla for less than 10k almost anywhere in the us if you qualify for the 4k tax credit and theyre great vehicles that can completely cover 99 of driving needs and obviously theres plenty of vehicles at higher prices if thats all you need to hear go for it assess your situation as always you should buy a car that suits your needs trucks for construction work vans for families etc evs are no different but you should ask yourself a few additional questions to determine which if any ev is right for you the first most important question do you have a place to charge the main benefit ev owners cite is that the vehicle can refuel at home every night in contrast the worst part of the experience is public charging even for superchargers which are widely considered the most reliable and easiest to use network charging takes longer than refueling with gas and almost always eliminates any cost savings from getting rid of gas its less common but you can also 100 get by if you charge at work or a public area like a shopping center you regularly visit whats your normal daily mileage how much battery do you need almost all full batterypowered evs bevs have 200 miles of range at this point you could even look at plugin hybrid ev phevs if you fit the specific usecase for it short daily use home charging and regular longer road trips although having a more complex vehicle that retains all the maintenance of a gas engine is for many too much of a drawback when bevs are becoming so capable do you plan to use this vehicle to regularly travel to a certain destination more than 100 miles away like a weekend ski trip or family in another state you can use apps like plugshare or a better route planner abrp to plot out these trips and see what public charging is available almost nowhere in the us is completely inaccessible to evs anymore but some places are much less convenient another way to ask the previous question is do you have another vehicle in your household a gas vehicle is in 99 of cases indisputably better for long distance travel compared to an ev if you decide that your vehicle will only ever charge at home outside of emergencies you can completely ignore fast charging rates which are relatively difficult to research and understand there are youll spend 13 of what you spent on gas 1500 in a year 500 in a year and youll have minimal maintenance costs i will say that if money is very tight youll find the best value in optimizing your purchase for your needs a used bolt leaf or egolf from the late 2010s wont have the range or charging speed of a model 3 or ioniq but could save you a bunch of money if you just need to go from your garage to work every day unzahn1 provided you can start to actually look into cars if you are new to evs you should contact a dealer and test drive one asap doesnt even matter what kind just go and try it youll never forget the first time you put the pedal to the floor in a hyundai and it accelerates like a porsche obviously youll have your own price range and vehicle preferences but heres what you should know about the electric side of things i would recommend starting with a filter for range and price and survey which vehicles are in your budget that meet your needs give yourself a shortlist and then start to think about your particular use case considering the following maximum fast charging speed sometimes called dcfc speed ignore this if you only plan on charging at home because it determines your maximum speed at a fast charger usually given in kilowatts kw or alternatively described by 10 to 80 charge time this is the peak charging rate a number of 50 kw is almost unbearably low 60 minutes to recharge while 150 is solid and 200 is as fast as they come 20 minutes to recharge this stat is not standardized so it has to be individually researched for each model youre interested in and its worth keeping in mind that its a maximum value which is affected by things like temperature and how many other people are charging one thing that might be helpful is to go on plugshare and check out the specific charging stations you expect to use the app encourages checkins from real users where they report their vehicle information as well as how their charge went fuel efficiency for ice vehicles miles per gallon mpg is a useful metric for showing the cost of running the vehicle its somewhat less important for evs because electricity is generally cheaper than gas but can be valuable information to know unfortunately there are 3 metrics for this in evs right now that all represent the same thing heres the short version mpge is an attempt to bridge the gap between gas and electric so the raw number is mostly meaningless for anything besides comparison bigger number is better typically above 100 mpge miles per kilowatthour mikwh is my favorite since its just milesgallon but swapped to the common unit for electric energy bigger is better and numbers range from 2 for trucks and go up to 5 for efficient sedans you can invert it and get kwhmi and since this is a decimal its often shown as kwh100 miles for this smaller is better and numbers range from 20 to 50 vehiclespecific subreddits are usually a good source of people reporting their numbers although be aware that people tend to selfreport their good numbers more than their bad ones understand what the range number means practically evs are more efficient in the city than on the highway by a significant margin this is because evs are more affected by aerodynamics and going faster will steadily eat into your range most highway range numbers are given for fairly conservative speeds of 6570 mph so if you want to go 80 youll shrink your range conversely ev drivers will commonly extend their range if needed by simply going slower electric motors and batteries also get less efficient in the cold by like 2030 combined this means that a car with 300 miles of advertised range will get an absolute maximum of 200 miles of range in cold weather and thats if youre charging to 100 and driving it down to 0 rain wind and snow are also killers for aerodynamic reasons good practice is to just cut the advertised number in half if you plan to do winter

electricvehicles,Anyone got any ideas.,"Hi,
So I have an MyEnergy Zappi connected to Octopus via a Hub connected to our router. 
It's been brilliant so far and it was free since it was left to us by the previous owners of the house. 

However, recently we have experienced some annoying hiccups. So we had a week without our EV due to some repairs. When it came back to us we plugged it in to find it would not charge the car. The Zappi displayed ""EV Disconnected"" after some investigating we found out it wasn't the car. It would charge on AC at various charging points near us. After pulling our hair out I called MyEnergy Technical Support where mysteriously while on phone and asked to plug the car in the charger started working fine. The support advisor checked the system online and seemed okay. 

We then go away on a long 2 and week bit holiday. Leaving the EV on the drive unplugged and on our return it's started doing the same thing. Same display ""EV Disconnected"" Only this time we can not get it to charge. Again it seems to charge on a various other charging points so we don't think it's the car but now MyEnergy aren't sure what the issue is. They are telling me I need to either replace the cable or have the unit refurbished at my expense due to being out of warranty. they advised me way to cleaning the connectors safely which have been done but no luck. 

There's no damage to the cable as far I can see and it's not been moved its just not been used in two weeks but how can it just suddenly stop working like that? I don't understand.

electricvehicles,How to solve Bmw i4 edrive40 iDrive stuck on the logo issue,"Hi, I’ve an i4 e40 2023 for couple days and I have an issue that i mentioned on the title.

This evening when I approached to the car; car was normally opened and when I get into the car, the idrive 8 screen stuck on the bmw logo and also the screen on the left and the steering wheel buttons were not responding for any attempt.

I’ve tried getting off from the car, and then locking fully and getting back into it but the screen did not turn off when I go further than the range of auto unlock distance (so it stuck “ON” continually)

I couldn’t be able to chose driver so the seat was not set automatically to my position.

I also tried to press the volume button (next to the hazard lights button) for a long time to reset idrive system and it doesn’t work.

After all that I came back to home and Plugged into my AC wallbox and went back to house. But my vehicle still has the same screen stuck error and the right side screen is always showing “BMW” logo in the center of it and keeps stuck.

I will drop the children off at school in the morning. And want to solve it before I leave the car in public parking.

electricvehicles,"Car is not charging, not sure what’s wrong; charger, cable or car","Hey, any help appreciated, thanks in advance!

My Cupra Born is not charging and I’m not sure why. As far as I can see there’s no one thing pointing towards either the charger (a myenergi Zappi), the cable, or the car.

The car recognises a cables connected to it but is not receiving a charge. The charger reports the cables connected and locked, but no EV is connected. The cable has done this before then worked again the next day.

I’ve tried all sorts of things:

-unplugging and reconnecting; trying both charger first and car first, no luck

-hard resetting the charger by turning it off at the fuse box, leaving it a minute or 2 then turning it back on, no luck

-restarting the cars infotainment system by holding the power button till it reset, no luck

-cycling through power deliver modes (eco, eco++, fast, stop) on the charger, no luck

We had this last week and was able to start charging using the granny charger. After the granny charger charged to 98%, trying the cable again it worked?!

I’m running out of things to try short of just using the slow charger but that is less than ideal.

electricvehicles,Plug & Charge User Experience,"I drive a BMW iX in the USA. For some time I have had Plug & Charge available for Electrify America.  More recently, a new Plug & Charge contract for Shell Recharge (including IONNA) has been available. I have both contracts installed on the car.  Recently, I made my first visit to an IONNA station.  Knowing that I have Plug & Charge set up, I plugged in the car, and was then met with an error message due to an authentication failure. Eventually, I figured out that I need to manually select the contract that I want to use. On looking in more detail at the 'power off' screen, I saw the car had recognized it was at an IONNA location and was prompting me to select if I wanted to switch to the Shell Recharge contract.  Once I had chosen to do so, I plugged the car in again and it worked fine. 

So my questions are these:

  
1. Other iX owners: am I doing something wrong, or is this the way the car always behaves when it has more than one Plug & Charge contract installed?

2. Do other car brands and models work similarly?

3. Given that the BMW (at least) knows that it's at a Plug & Charge compatible location, why can't it select the appropriate contract automatically? (I don't see any option for that.) Is this just an inconvenient UX choice, or is this somehow mandated for Plug & Charge compatible vehicles?

electricvehicles,New 3-row EV comparison,"Below is the summary by Google NotebookLM

* **Kia EV9**
   * **Price:** Starts at $54,900, or basically $55,000, making it the cheapest and best value vehicle in the three-row segment. The as-tested price of the specific model shown was just over $70,000, around $72,000. You can get the Land trim with a large battery pack and dual motor for this price. Leasing is also mentioned as very cheap, around $299 per month with about $2500 down (taxes included in Colorado).
   * **Range:** The video mentions the EPA rated range is put up. The large battery pack is almost 100 kilowatt hours. The range is described as ""not all that much,"" just under 100 kilowatt hours, but considered an ""easy justification"" for the price.
   * **Charging Performance:** Charging performance is noted as being good due to its EGMP platform. The peak charging speed is about 220 kW briefly, but most of the time it's about 200 kW, and it holds this speed deep into the pack, sitting at just about 200 kW up to 80%. This makes it an amazing charging vehicle for road trips. However, it's the only vehicle in the comparison that doesn't natively interface well with the Tesla Supercharger network, getting a maximum of 84 kW currently, though this is expected to increase to 125 kW for model year 2026. It uses an onboard booster for Supercharging and can be buggy.
* **Cadillac Vistic**
   * **Price:** Described as ""quite a bit more money than the Kia,"" starting around $80,000 base, with the as-tested model around $84,000. Higher trims can go up to $100,000.
   * **Range:** Shares the Lyric battery, which GM quotes as 102 kilowatt hours capacity, though it's closer to 105-106 kWh. The battery capacity is only about 10 to 20 kWh more than the smaller Equinox and Optic, which feels like a lot of money for the battery size in a large car. The range is mentioned as being one of the ""big oversightes"".
   * **Charging Performance:** The charging performance ""sucks,"" taking about 40 something minutes to charge from 10% to 80%. The peak charging speed is only 185-190 kW, making it the only vehicle in the comparison that can't hit 200 kW. The charging curve involves a boost profile for 5 to 10 minutes at 500 amps, then drops down, and is generally ""not a great curve"". It has ""crap charging performance,"" described as the ""worst of the bunch"". It requires a very low voltage system and needs ""all the amps in the world"".
* **Volvo EX90**
   * **Price:** Very expensive, with the as-tested price being $94,000. A base lease was mentioned as almost $1,100 per month. It is described as priced ""pretty well"" because it feels expensive. It feels more expensive than the Rivian by a lot.
   * **Range:** On paper, the range is described as ""kind of mid-tier"". It has around 100 kWh usable battery capacity.
   * **Charging Performance:** On paper, the charging is also described as ""kind of mid-tier"". It's a low voltage system architecture that requests 600 amps or more from a charging station, but public infrastructure in the US doesn't widely support this. On a Supercharger, it's locked at 500 amps, resulting in about 210 kW charging. Volvo claims 10-80% charging in 30 minutes, which is described as ""not that bad,"" but the curve is stepped. Its charging performance ""feels a bit weak sauce"" and ""a little bit prototypy,"" though potentially improvable over the air. It is one of the better vehicles in the comparison for charging time (10-80% in about 30 minutes). It is the only non-Tesla passenger vehicle sold in the US that requests more than 500 amps.
* **Rivian R1S**
   * **Price:** The most expensive vehicle in the comparison, with the as-tested price being $105,000. However, a Rivian R1S can be had for as low as $75,000. At $105,000, it's speced up with pretty much everything. The price is mentioned as something they ""don't like"". Even at $75,000 for a base one, it's considered ""kind of okay,"" but the quality is felt to have gone down from the first generation, and features are more often options now.
   * **Range:** Has the biggest battery of the bunch, around 145 kilowatt hours. It has the most range of capability.
   * **Charging Performance:** The peak charging speed is 210 kW on the tested model, which was slightly lower than an older Rivian model that got 219 kW. The charging performance ""sucks"" mostly due to thermal management. It's a big battery with weak cooling, causing the battery to get hot and limiting subsequent charging sessions. It's expensive to rely on DC charging with the Rivian as it's described as a ""brick"" and is the least efficient. It interfaces with the Supercharger network through an adapter and will soon have native ports.

In summary, the **Kia EV9** stands out for its **value** and solid, consistent charging performance up to 80%, despite having the lowest price and less overall range. The **Cadillac Vistic** is noted as a good highway cruiser but is criticized for its **slow charging speeds** and relatively small battery capacity for its price. The **Volvo EX90** is expensive but praised for feeling premium and driving well, with a good charging time, though its charging architecture is complex and its range/charging specs aren't top-tier on paper. The **Rivian R1S** is the most expensive vehicle, capable off-road, and has the biggest battery and most range, but is criticized for its build quality issues, relatively slow charging speeds for its battery size, and poor thermal management during consecutive charging sessions. The EV9 is considered the best budget option, the Vistic for the ""American guy"" who wants a cruiser, the EX90 is the preferred choice for on-road driving and overall quality, and the Rivian is for the ""lifestyle person"" who needs off-road capability.",2025-05-27 18:32:03,155,220,https://youtu.be/METibmN_xPg?si=XMI_sjIgauUCbomJ,"New 3-row EV comparison Below is the summary by Google NotebookLM

* **Kia EV9**
   * **Price:** Starts at $54,900, or basically $55,000, making it the cheapest and best value vehicle in the three-row segment. The as-tested price of the specific model shown was just over $70,000, around $72,000. You can get the Land trim with a large battery pack and dual motor for this price. Leasing is also mentioned as very cheap, around $299 per month with about $2500 down (taxes included in Colorado).
   * **Range:** The video mentions the EPA rated range is put up. The large battery pack is almost 100 kilowatt hours. The range is described as ""not all that much,"" just under 100 kilowatt hours, but considered an ""easy justification"" for the price.
   * **Charging Performance:** Charging performance is noted as being good due to its EGMP platform. The peak charging speed is about 220 kW briefly, but most of the time it's about 200 kW, and it holds this speed deep into the pack, sitting at just about 200 kW up to 80%. This makes it an amazing charging vehicle for road trips. However, it's the only vehicle in the comparison that doesn't natively interface well with the Tesla Supercharger network, getting a maximum of 84 kW currently, though this is expected to increase to 125 kW for model year 2026. It uses an onboard booster for Supercharging and can be buggy.
* **Cadillac Vistic**
   * **Price:** Described as ""quite a bit more money than the Kia,"" starting around $80,000 base, with the as-tested model around $84,000. Higher trims can go up to $100,000.
   * **Range:** Shares the Lyric battery, which GM quotes as 102 kilowatt hours capacity, though it's closer to 105-106 kWh. The battery capacity is only about 10 to 20 kWh more than the smaller Equinox and Optic, which feels like a lot of money for the battery size in a large car. The range is mentioned as being one of the ""big oversightes"".
   * **Charging Performance:** The charging performance ""sucks,"" taking about 40 something minutes to charge from 10% to 80%. The peak charging speed is only 185-190 kW, making it the only vehicle in the comparison that can't hit 200 kW. The charging curve involves a boost profile for 5 to 10 minutes at 500 amps, then drops down, and is generally ""not a great curve"". It has ""crap charging performance,"" described as the ""worst of the bunch"". It requires a very low voltage system and needs ""all the amps in the world"".
* **Volvo EX90**
   * **Price:** Very expensive, with the as-tested price being $94,000. A base lease was mentioned as almost $1,100 per month. It is described as priced ""pretty well"" because it feels expensive. It feels more expensive than the Rivian by a lot.
   * **Range:** On paper, the range is described as ""kind of mid-tier"". It has around 100 kWh usable battery capacity.
   * **Charging Performance:** On paper, the charging is also described as ""kind of mid-tier"". It's a low voltage system architecture that requests 600 amps or more from a charging station, but public infrastructure in the US doesn't widely support this. On a Supercharger, it's locked at 500 amps, resulting in about 210 kW charging. Volvo claims 10-80% charging in 30 minutes, which is described as ""not that bad,"" but the curve is stepped. Its charging performance ""feels a bit weak sauce"" and ""a little bit prototypy,"" though potentially improvable over the air. It is one of the better vehicles in the comparison for charging time (10-80% in about 30 minutes). It is the only non-Tesla passenger vehicle sold in the US that requests more than 500 amps.
* **Rivian R1S**
   * **Price:** The most expensive vehicle in the comparison, with the as-tested price being $105,000. However, a Rivian R1S can be had for as low as $75,000.

I bought EV-Easy limo about 8 months ago if anyone knows what that car is.

The issue is that in the dashboard there is  2 lines that become red just few seconds after I start driving I would upload a picture but the sub doesn't allow it, I feel no change at all with the driving or camers but I can't seem to find the issue anywhere, any ideas ?

electricvehicles,plug-in battery packs for extended range?,"The range that most (or at least, many) EV owners need day-to-day is significantly lower than the burst capacity we need for road trips. Lots of people who are new to EVs, though, are more focused on how much range they need for that twice-a-year trip they take to visit family for holidays or whatever than on their daily drive to the office an hour away.

I wonder if it'd be possible/feasible for EV manufacturers to make add-on battery packs that could be used periodically to increase the range of an EV. Basically a big ol' battery pack you can put in the trunk and plug in to give additional hundred miles or so of battery capacity for when you're going on a road trip. Dealerships could then rent these out for a couple of days or weeks at a time, then you return it when you're done with it.

Would this be something that could be possible for manufacturers to start doing at some point in the future?

***edit: ... and although cars themselves depreciate (not applicable for the car I bought in 2020), batteries depreciate more so than an average Toyota/Honda.",how long does it take to add 300km in a bevonly car yesterday i timed how long it takes me to fill up my toyota at a gas station the card tap took 7 seconds the cashier took another 11 seconds to authorize the pump finally it took about 1 min 35 sec to add just over 50 liters which the dash told me added 530 km i feel like a plug in hybrid is the best type of ev for me i can electrify my work commute 90 driving while keeping the benefits of combustion including free cabin heating in the winter reliability toyota and spending less money on a heavy depreciating asset battery i dont think the market currently sells a bevonly car that i wish to buy a plugin hybrid 7 seater van would be my perfect car i dont think it exists yet edit and although cars themselves depreciate not applicable for the car i bought in 2020 batteries depreciate more so than an average toyotahonda
electricvehicles,"Data after 50,000+ miles across a Bolt EUV and a Tesla Model 3","I have a separate meter for my 2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD that I use to track energy use, efficiency, cost (and cost-savings), etc., and compare back to very detailed data I kept on my previous ICE car. 

Given I've now driven >30,000 miles, it felt like a good time to share the data and because I had it, I also shared comparisons to the Bolt EUV.

**SAVINGS**  
*\*I benchmarked the fuel costs associated against my prior car, a Toyota Corolla which got 33.17 mpg over the 100,000+ miles I tracked it, and I also benchmarked against current gas prices, which in my area have been roughly $3/gallon but I am using nuanced* [*monthly averages for my state*](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM_EPMRU_PTE_NUS_DPG&f=W)*.

*\*\*I also calculated the portion of my savings that is due to taxes I'm not paying at the pump (0.285+0.184 per gallon) - which is relevant politically given we can expect a $250/year EV surcharge to attempt to ""close that loophole"", which for me, looks to be ""fair"" if it were state + federal, but just being federal and* combine*d with my state's surcharge ($75), it is not.* 

I have insurance, tabs, depreciation, maintenance, as well but wanted to focus on ""fuel"". Those costs are all higher than the Corolla due to the Tesla (and Bolt) being much newer cars (and fully insured instead of minimally insured) and the heightened costs do offset the fuel-savings for now. I'll be curious to see over 100,000+ miles how the total cost to own tightens up and I expect the Tesla to win out.

**Currently ex-depreciation/any cost of the vehicle, the Tesla is already winning at 15c/mile vs. the Corolla's 16c/mile** due to the cheaper maintenance and fuel despite the higher insurance and tabs. **But taking into account depreciation changes that comparison to $0.34 vs. $0.20 in favor of the Corolla - for now.** Which is a price I'm comfortable paying for enhanced safety, comfort, etc. 

**EFFICIENCY**  
Because it's always interesting to discuss - this is my ""efficiency"" based on the electricity I am actually paying for so it includes losses (and I am adding in charging away from home but that's been extremely minimal).

electricvehicles,I believe the federal EV tax would be worse than losing incentives.,"The federal tax is 250, which might not seem like that much, but that's on top of having to pay the state ev fee. In some states this would mean paying 500 or more annually and the number is certain to go up over time.

I think this has the possibility of affecting adoption more than the incentives going away could, for the simple fact there is no getting around paying. At least with incentives, car companies could adjust. Maybe they'll focus on selling cheaper cars with smaller batteries to make up the difference. But there would be no maneuvering around the tax.

electricvehicles,Why no EREVs with modestly sized batteries?,"To my knowledge, the US currently has no true EREVs (extended range EVs) available on the market today (correct?).  The only two that I know are coming are the Dodge Ramcharger and the Scout Terra, which for the Terra the gas engine would be an add-on. The Ramcharger's battery allows for 145 miles while the Terra's battery would give you a ballpark of 350 miles. 

Why not build an EREV with a battery sized for 60ish miles? A distance that would cover the daily needs of the vast majority of drivers and the range extender is there for towing or distance as needed. Batteries are the most expensive parts of EVs, and the battery would now be about 1/5th the size. Yes, there's the added cost of small engine. Even if the costs zeroed out (big battery only vs smaller battery with range extender), you'd fix the range anxiety issue with distance and/or towing. 

I realize we kind of have this with PHEVs, most of which get 35 mile-ish of range.  I feel a slightly bigger battery cost would be offset by not needing a transmission and complex hybrid design. And you'd have a true EV experience with lower total emissions.

electricvehicles,Realistic long term ownership outlook,"I have always been someone to buy a slightly used car, and keep it until it costs more to repair than keep person. I don’t need the latest tech, etc. I want safety, reliability and a reasonably comfortable ride.

electricvehicles,High speed railways increase electric car adoption,">The central issue, Fang says, is driver concern over “range anxiety,” or worry that their electric vehicles will run out of battery charge on longer-distance trips and end up stranding them. Such drivers primarily use their electric vehicles for shorter travel or commuting to work, yet still need transportation for longer trips. 

To answer the question of whether high-speed rail connections would accelerate electric vehicle purchasing, the researchers looked at monthly data on vehicle sales spanning 328 cities. They examined both cities before and after they were connected to the rail systems, as well as cities that had never been connected. And they examined additional factors, including the presence of electric vehicle charging stations, the volume of road investments, and the effects of government industrial policies, to determine whether those affected electric vehicle sales.

Their research found that cities that were connected to the rail network earlier were also those that saw the earliest growth in the electric vehicle market. The best strategy for accelerating electric vehicle purchases, they concluded, was the combination of “complementary infrastructure,” or high-speed rail, and incentives for consumer purchasing.

electricvehicles,Public EV charging in Germany is a mess – I’m working on a solution,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently working on an idea in the e-mobility space – specifically around public EV charging. The goal is to make the whole process cheaper, smarter, and less frustrating for drivers.

Here in Germany, the charging landscape is particularly fragmented and complex:
Different providers, roaming platforms, unpredictable pricing – and no one really knows what they’ll pay until after they’ve charged. I’d like to find a smarter and more user-friendly way to solve this.

The core idea is in place, and some early concepts are already mapped out. Now I’m looking to validate the idea further and shape it into a realistic MVP.

Since it’s been tough finding someone with the right tech background, I’m giving it a try here on Reddit.

If you have experience in backend or API development (especially in areas like roaming, OCPI, or anything EV-related) and want to work on something meaningful – I’d love to connect.

A co-founder role is definitely an option if things align well.
Happy to share more if you’re interested.

Thanks for reading – and apologies if this kind of post isn’t usually welcome here. Just wanted to give it a try.

Best,
Baba

Like, holy hell.  As a non-Ford, non-muscle car guy, I am really liking it.  It’s fast (duh) - rated at 3.5s 0-60.  Corners amazingly.  Is planted to the ground.  Even the fake Borla V8 sound is pretty fuckin cool.  The Bang & Olufsen sound system is amazing.  Not quite as good as the B&W in the BMW iX, but it’s pretty damned good. It has Unbridled mode which unleashes all the power.

The only complaint I have is with the CarPlay syncing.  On several occasions, the audio just cuts out for no good reason and it’s maddening to get it back.  And I want to hear my music!  Also road noise is fairly prevalent, especially on concrete/broken California roads.

That being said, this is the first Ford I’d consider. If you’re looking for a badass EV, I suggest checking out Hertz for low mileage examples.  They’re all $58k.  No, I do not work for nor am affiliated with Hertz or Ford at all.  Just my honest to goodness opinion.

We have owned non-Tesla ev’s like the Kia EV9 and Mustang that charged at non-tesla stations but never experienced anything like this where they are claiming our car was charging at a far away station at a time when we can document in 12 different ways that the car was in front of our house. 

Editing to add this has nothing to do with the login for my ChargePoint app. The charge was made through the Mercedes app for my specific vehicle, which requires multiple verification processes including a one time code sent to the screen on the vehicle. It was not charged to my CC by logging into my ChargePoint. It was charged from my Mercedes app through my specific vehicle to apply the charging credit issued by Mercedes, which is processed through Chargepoint. If you had my cars username and password, you could log into the MB app on MY phone but you couldn’t add my car to the MB app of your phone without having access to a lot more info, including a one time code sent to the vehicle.

mercedes_benz,Pure whistling 6th gear CLA 35,"Hello,

**Has anyone experienced a similar sound in CLA 35 AMG with 7-speed DCT?**

When gently accelerating in 6th gear at around 2000 RPM, there is a faint, repetitive whistling sound. It’s not loud, you really have to listen closely. The sound disappears right after passing about 2000 RPM or shifting to a higher gear — it’s like it switches on and off.

I went to the Mercedes service; the master technician heard it but didn’t confirm any fault. He said it’s likely a characteristic of the car and suggested leaving the car longer to “work through it” and check more thoroughly if there’s actually something wrong. Unfortunately, the service was very busy, and leaving the car longer would mean a very long wait.

I didn’t leave it longer because I wasn’t sure if it’s a real issue or just a normal trait of the car.

Has anyone else experienced this? Was it worth leaving the car for further checks, or is this just normal?

Thanks for your input!",2025-06-02 11:52:19,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mercedes_benz/comments/1l1dy9u/pure_whistling_6th_gear_cla_35/,"Pure whistling 6th gear CLA 35 Hello,

mercedes_benz,Currently MBFS is scared to do any deals unless you have impeccable credit of above average with multiple previous MB with them.,"I have never seen a lender so scared to buy their own brands deals. Supposedly MBFS is sitting on a lot of underperforming lease and purchase contracts. About 3 months ago they really began becoming very difficult. Some of the incentives that deals can pass along are 80 to 300% more just to encourage buys to take their financing outside MBFS. Normally not a problem but seeing 70-80% of all new MB deals are leases it is. For any of you leasing that have has any of you MB payments late( like not over 30 but not paid by the actual due date) you may be in for an unpleasant surprise. If you are utilizing a large part of your total available credit ( will tank your credit score) but have always been onetime with MB as well as your other obligations you too may get an unpleasant surprise. A few years ago if you paid MB perfectly but had lates on other obligations you were ok. Now they look as everything.. slow or and delinquencies regardless of your MB history they probably will not pick you back up. Before any of your leases are due you may want to look 3 months early to 1) utilize the payment waiver for 3 months but also to see if they will pick you back up. They are now going back years to see if a person is worth taking a risk on ( most are not ).., ok this is the end of my rant

mercedes_benz,Should I sell my C300 for a E350?,"Hi, so I’ve had by C300 for about a year now. It’s a 2009 C300 pre face lift. It’s a good starter car as I’m only 20, however I find it a little lack lustre. My model is basically the base package u can find as there’s no additional things to it like a backup camera which I’d like.

mercedes_benz,Been in a barn for 10 years! What's a good deal for me?,"1988 230E coupe, with about 211 000km (131 000mi) - been looking for a W124, and this one was in my area. figured I should ask those who know best before I jump the gun. 

The title sums it up. I'm curious what's a good deal on my end for this. What I'm most worried about is repairs on rust, as I'm no experienced welder, hence I dont want to be in over my head in that sense. Upholstery is all under control- something I have the means to manage. 

He claims the ""car channels"" are protected by the body. I've checked out the car myself- but I'm still in a process trying to learn. There's some rust developing around and up under the fenders, but noticeably, other than what hes pointed out himself. Otherwise there's the springs as well (but this is something I intend to swap). She turned over no problem for me.   


So what's your opinion? any criticism is welcome.   
  
I'm debating offering the equivalent of $3000 USD, in my currency, whilst he currently asking for $3900.

A friend of mine, who I know treats cars very very well, is selling his c220 CDI (w204 with OM651 engine). The car is in pristine condition, serviced every 10k kilometers and has 240k kilometers as of now.
I did a carvertical report on the car and everything is ok, the guy even sent me the proofs of services etc.. 
The only thing that scares me is the repairing costs, not even the servicing ones because I can do a service myself, but if something just happens to leak fluid or anything I know it’s going to be expensive.

mercedes_benz,2022 GLC 43 - Front tire wear (21 inch),"Apologies as I know this topic has been discussed before, but hoping to maybe update intel. 

I’ve got a ‘22 GLC 43 with the stock Continental summers. This is the offset setup with 21 inch wheels. 

Car has driven 2 seasons, 15k km total (which means max 10k km have been driven on the summers) as I am in Canada and have winters on for at least 4.5 months a year. 

Front tires are almost dead already. 2mm. 

The so-called “crabbing” or wheel skipping issue, which is common on this model, has been absolutely brutal as it is exacerbated by the fact that in this climate, even in non-winter months the average temperature is much lower and the problem is worse when it’s less than 15c (which is like 80% of the year in Quebec). 

My winter setup is square with 20 inch wheels. No issues whatsoever. 

I can’t help but imagine that the crabbing issue is wearing the fronts even faster than usual (I know these amg trims chew up tires, but 10k km is unbelievable). 

I’ll try to get some relief from the dealer for what I find to be a defect, but my bigger issue is what do I do going forward ?

Have people seen a significant improvement after switching to Michelin PS4S ? I could extend my winter tire window but I also don’t want to be driving on winters when it is bone dry and 15 degrees. 

I don’t love the idea of having to drop $3-4k every 10,000 km for tires. 

Any intel appreciated. ",2025-06-01 17:14:19,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mercedes_benz/comments/1l0rcm2/2022_glc_43_front_tire_wear_21_inch/,"2022 GLC 43 - Front tire wear (21 inch) Apologies as I know this topic has been discussed before, but hoping to maybe update intel.

mercedes_benz,"""The most expensive car is a cheap Mercedes""","We've all heard of this saying and while this certainly can be true (especially for top of the line benzes, loaded with electronics and complicated systems), it can also be a blessing in disguise for the people who like a good deal on an older MB. This anxiety helps depreciate ALL models, even the more reliable or less expensive to maintain ones.

Anyways, what I'm having trouble in understanding is this; let's say you pay 10k for a used benz which cost 100k when new and surprise surprise, a 5k repair bill shows up. While this certainly is a lot of money, do you think of it as 50 % of the cars worth or 5 %? How would you look at it if it was already repaired and sold for 15k? Still a good deal compared to the 100k new? 

Or rather; if you had to decide between a 5k repair bill or 5k in depreciation, which one would you choose?

mercedes_benz,"Would anyone be interested in a high-mileage W213 (600,000 km) restoration series? DIY, upgrades & OM654 overhaul?","Hey all,

I’ve made some YouTube and TikTok videos in the past, mostly around Mercedes-related stuff—simple repairs, driving clips, that kind of thing. Nothing major, but I enjoyed the process.

Now I’ve bought myself a new project: a W213 E-Class Estate (OM654 diesel automatic) with 600,000 km on the clock. It was a former taxi, but it’s a decent spec car and still in good shape considering the mileage.

My plan is to slowly restore and improve it over time. I’d film the process and share it ofc—similar style to M539 Restorations, but more budget-friendly in the beginning and realistic to the beginner level. I’m from Finland, so you’ll hear the accent for sure, but I’ll do everything in English.

Things I’m planning to document: 
•	Engine work (roller bearings, possibly turbo, timing stuff) 
•	Replacing tired plastics and interior parts 
•	Suspension refresh
•	Cosmetic upgrades (painting the interior roof black, possibly retrofitting a starlight headliner) 
•	Adding factory options like a heated steering wheel 
•	Coding and finding hidden gems in the system. 
•	VIN: WDD2132131A279846 if you’re curious 
•	Asking for advice and feedback along the way

I guess my question is: Would anyone actually be interested in following this kind of project? Would you want to see videos like that on YouTube/TikTok/Instagram? Videos would be mainly in Youtube, a serie. I have other Mercs also, so if all good, could make video series of multiple mercs. Or are restoration videos more of the bmw thing.

Thanks in advance!

mercedes_benz,C238: E450 vs E53 (2018-20) reliability,"I am thinking of purchasing a used E-Class coupe (2018-20). I believe to this day, this is one of the best looking cars mercedes has ever made both inside and out! I also like all the features that the car comes with, specially the ambient lighting. 

I currently own a 2024 Genesis GV70 and I love it, however, I don’t need the SUV and I want something more fun. Currently, I can easily trade in my car for a C238, however, I can’t decide between E450 vs E53 AMG. Obviously, AMG tax is real, but how real is it in this model? 🥲 

Can you guys help me decide between these two and provide me with approximate yearly cost to maintain each?

mercedes_benz,Need help with a Mercedes c250 2013 that won’t start after crash,"Hey guys not sure in a bit of a rut. I was in a hit and run accident, the person was in a 4/4 truck and ran off. 
The worked fine after but a few days in, it stopped like lost power in the middle of the road still in drive. 

It wouldn’t even take ignition like nothing comes up when I try to start. 
Intially I thought it stopped communicating and went into emergency mood.

But open opening the hood, I relaised the small air intake turbo pipe had melted off like completely (common issue with c250)

I order the part and replaced it, jump started again, nothing, cars dead, it won’t even read any scanners like no codes whatsoever ever.

Had it towed to a shop, I don’t know how much they worked on it, but said oh it’s the ecu it’s not communicating, because even in their scanner no codes showed up. They can’t access the back because well it’s hit pretty bad and would have to be cut out open to access the fuse boxes.

Any reccomendations or any experience with this? Insurance has denied the claim (long story) 

So the cost is coming out of pocket. I’m in Houston area east downtown the shop was like you are looking at 4500 minimum (which I thought was a little high) but he was trying to have me salvage it or suggested I do that.

I have it sitting at another shop but so far nothing and they aren’t able to figure either.

mercedes_benz,Magnesium Moment (M113),"Magnesium is great, but it's porous and it gets worse with time. In extreme cases or in particularly fragile spots, it can basically disintegrate line you see here - and it's magnesium, so you can't really weld it. Cars made around 2010 and newer warrant a once-over, especially when they're running or particularly are idling sort of weird.

Classic hits include the magnesium throttle plate in the M156 (many billet options now available) the magnesium manifolds on the 272/273 and M112/M112 (No real fix for these yet - 272 and 273, you'll be replacing for a runner flap failure well before the manifold dissolves. 112/113, you will likely find problems when you remove the manifold, whether it's porosity or the runner flap non-replaceable vacuum hose being decayed), and even the valve covers on most of the above. This is particularly complex on the 272 and 273, considering the cam bearings are integrated into the valve covers. You quite literally cannot remedy the situation unless you're willing to replace the cylinder head. 

So, considering there's no fix, what will I do with my 113 manifold? Well, aside from this, the manifold looks pretty okay. I'm going to scuff this crack clean, use some repair epoxy, and sand it down flush. I may even clean the rest of the manifold and treat it to a nice coat of paint!",2025-06-01 02:27:39,4,0,https://i.redd.it/jod9i82wm74f1.jpeg,"Magnesium Moment (M113) Magnesium is great, but it's porous and it gets worse with time.

mercedes_benz,E400 coupe vs C43 coupe,"Hi,
I was looking for a used car to buy. Budget - 30k€. Been looking for some sporty yet still a good daily. Since I really like german cars, I found a nice 2017 E400 coupe with 45k miles on it (1st owner, no issues, very nice interior). The car is listed for 33k. Little over my budget but that car is so nice I wouldn't mind spending more on it. But than I found another beauty. The 2017 C43 AMG coupe with 91k miles on it (2nd owner, no issues, seems nice). Since the car has more miles on it, it's listed for 27k. So now I need your opinions. Is the extra 50hp and AMG exhaust worth it? Or should I go for more luxury and less miles with the E400? Or is there better car for the same price? Needs to be petrol. Thx and appriciate every response.

mercedes_benz,Mercedes C300de,"Greetings everyone, I was wondering about people experiences with the plug-in hybrid version of the 2.0 diesel engine. I'm not really educated on the whole plug-in system in Mercedes Benz cars, so I was wondering what do people that actually own these cars think, what are your experiences and thoughts. Long term service plans and such. And is it even worth getting the PHEV version, or is it simply better to go for the standard 2.0d version.

I'm thinking of buying a new Mercedes A250e and I have a question that you might be able to answer.

My garage currently has a maximum allowable power of 1.15kVA. This is approximately 5A.

Does anyone know if it's possible to charge the 2025 A250e at this current with the stock AC charger? Even if it does take more time to charge?

I'm trying to ask my supplier to increase the available power, but it seems like a slow process and I wanted to know if I can charge it while I wait. (I live in Portugal)

mercedes_benz,Advice Needed - 2009 E350 with 161K got the repair and maintenance bill from a locally owned shop,"Bought this car last year for $6,000. Spent $4,300 on a Gold Standard warranty which is prorated refundable for the remaining term (19 years, lol).

Vehicle is not AMG nor 4MATIC insofar as I am aware. I am the 3rd owner.

**Seeking advice if I should just do the oil change, cancel the warranty and trade / sell the car.** Warranty cancellation should be around $4,085 refunded. Might be able to get $1,500 to $2,100 as a trade for another vehicle but guessing it will be closer to $1,500 according to KBB. Meanwhile private party sale is looking like maybe $3,900 - $5,300. I could take that combined cash towards a down payment on a new (or CPO) vehicle. I would rate the vehicle as in good condition in accordance with the KBB condition quiz.

Local shop is quoting me the following for repairs and maintenance, labor, fluids and maintenance services are not covered by the Gold Standard warranty. I have recently replaced the battery for $180. I am still waiting to hear back from the shop on exactly what will and will not covered by the warranty. Note that I am not a mechanic nor do I know how to really fix a car at all. But some of these labor rates seem sky high?

bmw,M340i downpipe flow on effects (Aus),"Hey all, just a quick one,

I'm looking into downpipes and possibly a mhd tune, and have a question around the safety tech.

In my old car if a cel was thrown the auto cruise control etc would all be disabled. 

If a cel is thrown in the m340i the same, or does all the autonomous driving etc still function as expected?

And does a mhd tune actualy remove the cel or just stop the dash light? 

Just working out if a highflow cat / catless and tune is the way to go over the AA downpipe as that is 4 times the price of a handful of others due to the no cel promise.

bmw,"2023 BMW X1 — Power Loss, Fuel Confusion, and Lack of Clear Communication","Hi everyone,

I wanted to share my experience with a BMW X1 (8,000 km). The car was built in Aug 2023 and purchased brand new in Feb 2024. From day one, I followed the fuel cap instructions: “MIN 91 / RON 95”, and consistently used RON 95 from reputable stations.

Despite that, the car experienced repeated power loss at highway speeds. BMW first replaced the battery and said it was fixed. When the issue returned, they told me to start using RON 98—something never previously mentioned.

I’m not a car expert. If I'd been told that from the start, I absolutely would’ve used RON 98. Now I feel misled by the labeling, and the car may have suffered damage as a result.

The fact that the issue returned after being ""fixed"" makes me question if they ever resolved the root cause. I'm currently going through the VCAT tribunal.

Others have shared similar stories online, and I believe this could reflect a broader issue around fuel standards or vehicle calibration for Australia. It deserves more attention, especially with our safety involved.

Thanks for reading.

bmw,Just got my first BMW - an F90 M5!,"Hi all,

This is going to be long, because I’m going to catalog everything I’ve done up to this point, rather than make 23 posts about various stuff. Hopefully you find it mildly entertaining.

It took 20 years of wanting and wishing, but I finally own an M5. I got a used 2019 F90 in Black with the Executive package with about 36k miles, and it’s literally everything I dreamed of. This car is the first time I’ve gotten something I hyped myself up over and haven’t ended up disappointed. Every time I get in it, I’m smiling. Worth it. Absolutely worth it.

The features! From soft-close doors and all-leather interior to the lighted headrests in the 900-way power memory seats to the little BMW logos that appear on the ground when you open the doors at night, it just screams luxury. Then you start it up and the amazing twin-turbo V8 booms and grumbles to life and the smiles appear.

So far, on a completely closed and safe track and definitely not on the back road close to my house, I’ve had it up to 107 mph. This was just a quick rip due to limited assured clear straightaway and safety concerns, so maybe ten seconds from stop to 107 and then back down again to normal speeds. Last car was a Chevy Volt. Imagine coming from that appliance to this stallion. Yeah, I could get in trouble pretty easy here.

Now let’s talk about buying a used sports car. :) 

As bought, the car had an AWE straight pipe cat-back system plus some brand of aftermarket carbon fiber kidney grills, rear diffuser and rear spoiler. Upon closer inspection of the front bumper, the self-tapper holes and vestiges of double-sided tape make me think there was a carbon fiber front lip as well that probably didn’t make it out of a driveway or something and got torn off. 

I think all of this aftermarket stuff is poo poo.

The exhaust system absolutely would wake the dead and even with the flaps closed and the engine set to efficiency, the droning noise was unbearable. I ended up buying a stock M5 Competition system on eBay, which arrived on a pallet cut into four pieces AND a forklift operator (I’m sure they were certified) had run into it and bent one of the front pipes. Well, there goes me installing it myself. Got a local muffler shop to weld it all back together and bend the pipe back to an approximation of “right”, and install the system on the car. $300 and that was done. However, the system hit the X-brace and made a rattle, and the shop wouldn’t install the flap actuators. Whatever, I’ll fix it.

I ended up dropping the brace down one corner at a time and installing two washers under each bolt, and then tightening them back to “eh, that feels about right”. This worked great, and took several hours due to access issues and washers falling off the brace. 

The actuators I swapped off of the AWE system, but of course the clips are different. Great. Don’t wanna wait to order them and can’t live with this horrid rattle! So, went online, found a listing for the clips with a photo of their shape and bent my own out of 316L TIG wire I had laying around. This worked perfectly and I haven’t needed to do anything further after initial installation. It took a little longer than expected to accomplish this because my 2-year-old son stole all my tools, several of the mounting bolts, AND came within literally a couple millimeters of poking me directly in the pupil of my eye with the aforementioned TIG wire. I was EXTREMELY lucky and it hit my eyelid instead of permanently blinding me. Toddlers, man.

Oh, and I picked up BimmerCode and disabled the piped-in exhaust noise. What a dumb idea.

Finally, the car had that BMW refinement my wife and I expected, while still absolutely ripping down the road. Nice!

Wish I could get the stock kidney grills at least, but DAMN are those expensive, and my wife is still in shock over buying a car that cost twice what our last one did, so that’ll have to wait. eBay has used ones, but they’re either nearly new price or beat to hell with scratches and chips in the chrome.

Apart from the aftermarket stuff, whoever owned this before must’ve tailed a gravel truck for a living. I have never before seen so many rock chips on a car. I mean, literally a hundred little pinhole chips here, there, everywhere on the front bumper, hood, and of course all four wheels. In fact, when I took down the 87 pieces of plastic to access the cross brace rear bolts, piles of actual gravel fell out. Tiny little triangular crushed stone, like you’d see on a poorly resurfaced road. Well, the car lived in Illinois before I got it, so perhaps it saw gravel roads or the terrible streets of Chicago. 

Anyway, I filled about a billion holes in the hood with a touch up pen and wet sanded all those flat before compounding, polishing and waxing the hood today. What amazing paint. It’s beautiful. Attaching the result, so hope that shows up.

I took the wheels off because I’m pretty sure they’ve never, ever been cleaned. The barrels and spokes have a ton of chips, but nothing that went through the paint completely.  

Somehow, all four wheels have mild to moderate curb rash (this car has 360-view cameras for parking) so I have to assume either potholes or drunkenness was involved. The only other option is my wife drove it, since her Volt has wheels that look about the same.

I used a Dremel and ground out and contoured the damaged areas before polishing them back to a smooth finish to match the rest of the polished aluminum rim. Now unless you look for it, you can’t tell they’ve been abused. Yay! 

Finally, I scrubbed everything and applied Gyeon uh, Rim? I guess it’s called? ceramic coating to the entire wheel barrel and face to hopefully make cleaning the brake dust easier. Did the same to the calipers, since they looked brown instead of blue. This whole cleaning and protecting process took a full summer day to accomplish. The wheels already look filthy again. Haven’t had the time or energy to pull the hose around to wash them off.

I still need to compound and polish the rest of the car to get rid of all the light scratches and holograms from I assume neglectful use of snow brooms and automatic car washes. Takes forever to do a panel, since I’m damn scared to cut through the clear coat and end up needing a respray. 

Even without that done, though, we’ve already gotten two spontaneous “nice car” compliments from random guys. I have never received a compliment about my car before. It’s weird and great. I’m actually proud to own a vehicle for the first time ever.

Apart from cosmetic improvements, I’m pretty much certain this car should come with at least a coupon for a radar detector, if not just having one installed from the factory. I live in constant fear of getting caught driving, uh, completely normally and at or below the speed limit, as I always do of course. I’d love to get one of those Uniden custom install units with the detectors hidden behind the bumpers and the laser transceivers are built into the fascia, but $7000!! Guess I’ll have one hanging off my windshield, bein’ all ugly and stuff.

I’d love to keep this car for at least a moderate amount of time, and it’s my wife’s daily ride to work, so I figure it could see some serious mileage on it within a few years. Maintenance is going to be important. Here’s things I learned after committing to purchase:

Brake pads and rotors, parts only, are about $2000

It takes special, expensive oil, which I knew. It takes a lot of it, which I didn’t. It’s apparently recommended to change it more often than the factory maintenance interval.

The drive line has three fluid-containing parts that better be changed on schedule, and there isn’t or wasn’t a schedule when the car was released.

Leather is everywhere in the interior and must be cleaned and preserved regularly.

Alcantara headliner. Jizz spots on Alcantara headliner. Only fingernail and hot water will safely remove.

Brake fluid must be changed regularly. It is, of course, special brake fluid.

I’m sure I’m forgetting half a dozen things, but this is getting too long to keep writing. Anyway, it’s been a fun first month of ownership and now I’m an addict.

bmw,Which used B58 model?,"Hey y'all. Looking for a new(used) car within the next year. My Accord 2.0T is a fun grocerymobile but I'm getting bored with it. 

I want something with AWD and more tuning potential. B58 BMW's look enticing.

My budget is 30k. I'm looking at cars 3-4 years old.  

I'm torn between models though. With a tune, most B58's will put down the same power (AFAIK). And the curb weight between various xdrive models isn't that different. 

Models I'm looking at 
* X3 XDrive40i
* M240i
* M340i
* 540ix
* Others I should look at? Let me know. 

I don't particularly care about suspension. I never go to track. I don't need passenger space either. I just want to press gas pedal and feel wheeeey. My mods will be limited to a tune and 93 octane.

I like that X3 can tow, but I won't be doing so often (maybe 2x a year). I also like the evelated seating of SUV and higher ground clearance. I take road trips to mountainous areas a couple times a year. The main drawback is 4400lb curb weight, 400 lb heavier than most other models. 

The 5 series depreciates like crazy and looks like the best deal on paper. But I'm worried about high maintenance costs for all the fancy gizmos. 

M340i prices are surprisingly higher than other models. I'm not sure why. 

Are some of these models more reliable than others? Did some come with bigger turbos, fuel pumps, or otherwise have better tuning potential? 

Should I just get the ""sportiest"" one m240i? Or are 0-60 times basically the same when tuned for all of them? 

I hear certain years/models have locked ECU's. Maybe that's a reason to lean a certain way? 

The only comfort feature I really care about is Android Auto.

BMW has so many different models and options and their naming scheme is insane so I'm kinda lost here lol.

",which used b58 model hey yall looking for a newused car within the next year my accord 20t is a fun grocerymobile but im getting bored with it i want something with awd and more tuning potential b58 bmws look enticing my budget is 30k im looking at cars 34 years old im torn between models though with a tune most b58s will put down the same power afaik and the curb weight between various xdrive models isnt that different models im looking at x3 xdrive40i m240i m340i 540ix others i should look at let me know i dont particularly care about suspension i never go to track i dont need passenger space either i just want to press gas pedal and feel wheeeey my mods will be limited to a tune and 93 octane i like that x3 can tow but i wont be doing so often maybe 2x a year i also like the evelated seating of suv and higher ground clearance i take road trips to mountainous areas a couple times a year the main drawback is 4400lb curb weight 400 lb heavier than most other models the 5 series depreciates like crazy and looks like the best deal on paper but im worried about high maintenance costs for all the fancy gizmos m340i prices are surprisingly higher than other models im not sure why are some of these models more reliable than others did some come with bigger turbos fuel pumps or otherwise have better tuning potential should i just get the sportiest one m240i or are 060 times basically the same when tuned for all of them i hear certain yearsmodels have locked ecus maybe thats a reason to lean a certain way the only comfort feature i really care about is android auto bmw has so many different models and options and their naming scheme is insane so im kinda lost here lol

bmw,Finished Product of the Front Mounted Dual Air Intake for E60 550i,"finalized this project today! it’s wrapped in a reflecting heat wrap because i noticed the gets very warm inside the engine bay so hopefully this will keep it cooler. 

got pictures of the piping kit we used, the slots you fit the pipe through, and also just a FYI we did have to bend the ac lines just a tad, so if you do plan to do this just be careful! i had assistance from my dad who has previously done projects similar to this so he was guiding me through this whole time. we also have a garage that has all the tools you could ever imagine so it made this project easier than it could have been. the maf sensor is right in the center of the two legs (it definitely isn’t getting accurate readings but the car isn’t sending any codes and it’s running great). if you do choose to do this project, please tag me! i wish people would work on this engine more and give it a chance. i haven’t seen hardly anyone modify this engine besides exhaust & dinan intake work and it’s a little disappointing. i want to put a lot more work into this engine and show y’all the potential!

we used screwdrivers, sockets, band saw, grinder, and files. it’s not a lot of tools needed but i was just lucky enough to have a garage with these tools so it was inexpensive for me.

bmw,Talk me out of getting a 3 series,"Been eyeing a few 2021-2024 3 series with around 20k miles that seem relatively affordable. I currently have a 2010 venza that’s reliable, has about 140k miles and running well, paid off, and I could probably drive it another 200k miles if not more.

The 3 series ~$27k range, Obviously more expensive than that for the 2024 versions, and would mean a monthly car payment as well as possibly more expensive repairs. 

Is it worth switching to a smaller car, more expensive to maintain, to have a car I enjoy? Also, needs to be a relatively spacious 4 door as I have a 1 year old that uses a car chair.

bmw,New to BMWs/ 430i,"I’ve been drawn to the 4 series coupes for a while. I’m also looking to buy a new car. As someone who’s new to the BMW brand, I would expect the price of the used cars to be higher, though. I’ve seen several 2019-2020 430i with no accidents and 30-50k miles selling for low- mid $20,000’s. For reference, I test drove a ‘22 Honda accord sport with 31k miles today that was selling for $28,000.

I’ve heard that BMW’s in general require more maintenance and tend to start having problems earlier, although I couldn’t tell you where or when I heard this. I’m not sure how try these claims are, but the fact I’ve seen several selling online for less than a similar year Honda accord with about the same miles and comparable features, makes me feel uneasy for some reason.

bmw,Transmission issue,"have changed valve body (mechatronics unit) of my bmw X1 2010. Car is not starting after that. It was starting before that but was slipping out of gears.

Is it possible to start the car without putting the filter back on and filling the transmission fluid ?(so to not drain the fluid again and again to do troubleshooting)

One thing I was wondering is that male connector on car have 14 pins while the mechatonics unit itself have 16 pins, I'm wondering if I have pushed 2 pins inside the connector while removing it or is it just how it is supposed to be

According to ista, there is no communication with transmission control unit or transfer box

When i push the gas the car bumps/misfires for a couple seconds and then i usually get the error message, when i turn off and on the car agian the message is gone but when i do a hard pull it comes back, as a broke student i really need some help, ive also noticed some kind of weird sound from under the car and god i hope not its actually the drivetrain thats broken, i only got 11000 eu miles :(  What do you guys think?

bmw,"BMW Ultimate Protection CPO Protection Plan, worth?","I bought a 2022 330i xDrive yesterday with about 9,700 miles on it. Factory warranty on it expires end of year on 12/31/2025 and there's another year of CPO warranty on it that ends on 12/31/26. 

Think I made a mistake buying the 2 year/unlimited miles warranty on top of it that makes it end on 12/31/28 for $3,200. More I think about it, I don't think I needed it probably wasn't thinking logically in the moment. I drive about 10k miles a year so by the end of that warranty I'd be at roughly 45-50k miles, MAX of 60k.

For the money I don't think it's worth it but thought I would get the subs opinion. I am always on top of my maintenance but I think being my first Beamer I panicked a little and bought even though everything I read has pointed to the B48 being reliable as long as you stay on top of everything (which I will).

bmw,The 330i is the top contender for my next car. Anything that might shock me coming from a 2020 Honda Civic Hatchback?,"Hi there, new to the sub! Since my dad worked at BMW, I've always wanted one but never had the finances to make it work out. Now that I'm pushing close to 40, money has finally aligned for trading in my 2020 Honda Civic EX Hatchback for a lightly used 2024/2025 BMW 330i (G20) in about 1 or 2 years time.

Some things that sold me on the platform:

- ZF8. ZF8. ZF8. My biggest complaint about the Civic is the uninspired CVT.
- Minor: xDrive or RWD. I'm a bigger believer in choosing the correct tire for the climate than the right drive-train, but the option for either RWD or xDrive is nice over FWD. I'm an experienced RWD driver FWIW.
- According to Car Sized it's not terribly bigger than the Civic! I like smaller cars. https://www.carsized.com/en/cars/compare/honda-civic-2016-5-door-hatchback-vs-bmw-3-2022-sedan/
- More power on tap

Some things that concern me:

- I'm largely allergic to tech, especially tablets replacing AC controls, and CarPlay replacing compact discs and AUX. This is true for nearly every car these days, but I know BMW is more ""tech-focused"" than Honda.
- I'll miss the hatchback (and, no, I don't want an SUV)
- I'll miss the gas mileage or the opportunity to go hybrid.

Which one should I pick?

bmw,M3 CS - UK Test Drive/Eligibility,"I currently have a G80 M3 Competition and I’m intrigued as to what a CS Touring version would be like. I see things online like it’s a hard ride or that there’s no centre console etc. so it would be nice to see/try one out before contemplating buying one.

Anyway I go to the BMW UK site and you can request to test drive all their cars, I found the CS touring and submitted a request to my local dealership.

24 hours later I get an email advising that the CS variants aren't something they get into stock or test drive. They're sold by interest register only, then BMW reviews the application and decides whether the customer is successful or not.

Is this true? Seems pretty crazy that you can’t see or test one when they start at £126,000!

bmw,I can’t decide please help !!,"Hey guys I need some advice!!.

I have a budget of $35- $40k  for my first car and I was looking at some cupra’s however I’m thinking of saving that money and investing it rather than spending that amount on a new car considering I’m only 19 and on my ps 

Before anyone says I’m spoiled or whatever I’ve been working my ass off for my money so thought I should please my self with a little toy. 

Now the options I have is either a buy a roughly new 2023 - 2024  cupra Leon and hope that it will be with me for the next couple of years or take my parents old car 2016 bmw x5 40d.

The thing with the x5 is that it’s already done 160kms 
And it needs some new rims, new brake pads , rotors which I’m not really sure how much it would cost. The car runs smooth and I really seem to enjoy the power it produces considering the turbo engine. 

What I need help is in deciding on what I should do ? 
Should I just get the x5 and fix it up and hope it will last me a while or is it already considered beat up as it’s done over 150kms. The car value currently is around $20000 and I can’t seem to find my self a good car roughly same year with the same power.

Let me know what you guys would do? Or what you think I should do thanks . 

What would you guys think if I sold the x5 for this

bmw,BMW 118i (2020) – Hood Latch Issue? Knocking Sound When Turning Right,"Hey all,

I drive a 2020 BMW 118i and recently noticed a weird knocking sound whenever I turn right. I popped the hood and noticed something odd, the left-side hood latch is fully seated and flush, but the right-side latch seems to be raised and not locking down the same way (images attached).

It almost looks like the right latch isn't catching properly, and I’m wondering:

* Is this normal for the G20/G21-style bonnet latch system?
* Or is the right latch broken and in need of adjustment or replacement?

Has anyone had a similar issue or know how to fix it?

Appreciate the help!

bmw,X1 vs X3,"In the market for a preowned daily driver. Do a combo of city/suburban/highway.  Like the way both drive. The X3 is a little bigger and gets less mpg.  I actually preferred the handling of the X1 but not the turbo lag.  

X1 doesn’t have the B48 which I am told is very reliable, is the X1 there for less reliable and something to be concerned with?

Looking at 2022-2024 models (I understand the X1 went through a refresh in 23).  

Considering purchasing via Carmax to buy their Maxcare.  Will keep the car for 5-7 years. 15k per year on average for miles.

Hey everyone,
I’m considering buying a 2017 BMW 4 Series · 430i Convertible 2D with 62,000 miles on it, and I’d love to get some honest opinions from people who’ve owned one or know the ins and outs.

A few things I’m curious about:
	•	Fuel efficiency: I’ve read it gets around 23 city / 34 highway MPG — how accurate is that in real-world driving?
	•	Reliability: Any common issues I should be aware of at this mileage? I’ve seen mixed info on the B48 engine — should I be worried?
	•	Convertible top: Any known problems with the mechanism or seals?
	•	Infotainment system: Does it hold up well over time? Any annoying glitches?
	•	Maintenance costs: I know it’s a BMW, so I’m expecting some cost — but anything unusually expensive or failure-prone?

Anything else you’d want me to know before pulling the trigger on one of these?

Thanks in advance — I really appreciate your insight!

bmw,2008 650i review,"
[REVIEW] 2008 BMW 650i Coupe – The V8 GT That’s a Drama Queen in a Tuxedo


So I’ve been dailying a 2008 BMW 650i coupe for a while now. It’s sitting at just 106,000 km (aka 65,800 miles for the Imperialists among us), and I figured I’d drop a full breakdown of what it’s like to live with a Bavarian V8 GT car from the late 2000s. Spoiler: it’s equal parts love story and psychological thriller.

🔥 The Pros – AKA “Why I Still Look Back at It in Parking Lots”
	•	That N62 V8 Growl:
	•	4.8L of naturally aspirated goodness
	•	360 hp, buttery smooth, and sounds absolutely glorious under throttle
	•	It doesn’t just purr—it snarls like a panther with anger issues when you open it up
	•	Grand Touring Credentials:
	•	Eats up highway kilometres like they’re Tic Tacs
	•	Surprisingly comfy for long hauls—perfect if you want to pretend you’re James Bond on the QEII
	•	Trunk space is actually decent for a coupe (fits golf clubs, or hockey gear if you don’t mind some creative angling)
	•	Looks that Still Turn Heads:
	•	That Chris Bangle design may have been divisive in 2008, but damn if it hasn’t aged like fine schnapps
	•	Long hood, short deck, low slung—she’s got that “executive menace” energy
	•	People still ask, “Yo, what year is that? Is that the V10 one?” (which feels like a weird flex, but I’ll take it)
	•	Interior Fit & Finish:
	•	Leather dash, solid-feeling materials, iDrive that mostly works
	•	Sport seats are bolstered like a German wrestling hold
	•	Feels like a proper luxury GT, not just a sporty coupe trying too hard

😬 The Cons – AKA “What’s It Trying to Kill Me With This Week?”

[REVIEW] 2008 BMW 650i Coupe – The V8 GT That’s a Drama Queen in a Tuxedo


So I’ve been dailying a 2008 BMW 650i coupe for a while now. It’s sitting at just 106,000 km (aka 65,800 miles for the Imperialists among us), and I figured I’d drop a full breakdown of what it’s like to live with a Bavarian V8 GT car from the late 2000s. Spoiler: it’s equal parts love story and psychological thriller.

🔥 The Pros – AKA “Why I Still Look Back at It in Parking Lots”
	•	That N62 V8 Growl:
	•	4.8L of naturally aspirated goodness
	•	360 hp, buttery smooth, and sounds absolutely glorious under throttle
	•	It doesn’t just purr—it snarls like a panther with anger issues when you open it up
	•	Grand Touring Credentials:
	•	Eats up highway kilometres like they’re Tic Tacs
	•	Surprisingly comfy for long hauls—perfect if you want to pretend you’re James Bond on the QEII
	•	Trunk space is actually decent for a coupe (fits golf clubs, or hockey gear if you don’t mind some creative angling)
	•	Looks that Still Turn Heads:
	•	That Chris Bangle design may have been divisive in 2008, but damn if it hasn’t aged like fine schnapps
	•	Long hood, short deck, low slung—she’s got that “executive menace” energy
	•	People still ask, “Yo, what year is that? Is that the V10 one?” (which feels like a weird flex, but I’ll take it)
	•	Interior Fit & Finish:
	•	Leather dash, solid-feeling materials, iDrive that mostly works
	•	Sport seats are bolstered like a German wrestling hold
	•	Feels like a proper luxury GT, not just a sporty coupe trying too hard

😬 The Cons – AKA “What’s It Trying to Kill Me With This Week?”
	•	N62 Engine Quirks (aka: “Drip Happens”):
	•	Valve stem seals = basically a subscription service to burning oil
	•	Coolant transfer pipe is a ticking time bomb unless it’s been replaced (do your homework)
	•	Vacuum leaks and VANOS gremlins love to play hide and seek
	•	Electronics Have a Mind of Their Own:
	•	iDrive is like that one friend who’s mostly chill until you need them in a crisis
	•	Every 6 months: “Hello, I’m a new sensor! I’ve decided to fail for no reason.”
	•	Adaptive headlights occasionally forget how to adapt
	•	Maintenance Ain’t Cheap:
	•	Even basic parts are like, “This is imported, sir”
	•	Labor? Hope you have a BMW specialist nearby who doesn’t charge in kidneys
	•	Preventative maintenance is key—or you’ll be doing reactive maintenance in a parking lot while Googling torque specs
	•	Weight:
	•	She thicc. Nearly 4,000 lbs
	•	Handles well enough for what it is, but you’re not carving canyons like an E92 M3
	•	More of a fast cruiser than a tossable corner-carver

bmw,BMW 330e hybrid problem,"**Problem Overview:**

* The car will run on electric for only about 1 km before its EV power gradually fades and it forces a switch to gasoline—even if the HV battery still has charge.
* You’ll see “Electric Drive Restricted” on the dash, and sometimes a “Drivetrain Error” when you try to accelerate or brake for regen.
* ISTA+ consistently reports a fault on **Cell Supervision Circuit 5** (codes like 21F126 for overvoltage or 21F137 for undervoltage) and related ERM messages (e.g., 21A003/21A111/21A124).

**What’s Actually Happening:**

1. **Cell 5 Goes Out of Safe Range**
   * Under load, one (or more) of the 12 cells in “Circuit 5” sagged below the minimum safe voltage (\~1.6 V under heavy discharge) or rose above the maximum safe voltage (\~4.2 V on charge).
   * When ISTA+ logged a reading of about **1.57 V on that cell**, the BMS immediately tripped a fault (21F137 undervoltage) and opened the HV contactors to protect the pack.
2. **BMS Opens Contactor → EV Power and Regen Shut Off**
   * As soon as the contactors open, the inverter is completely disconnected from the HV battery. That means no electric propulsion AND no regenerative braking is possible—because there’s literally no HV path to send current back into.
   * If you try to brake (regen) or accelerate, the DME/ERM sees that the inverter won’t respond (because it’s unpowered) and reports **“Drivetrain Error.”** In other words, regen cannot “save” the weak cell, because the BMS forcibly isolates the entire HV system the moment it detects a dangerous cell voltage.
3. **Why Simply Scooping a Fault Is Not Enough**
   * Pulling the HV fuse or a quick restart does not override the BMS logic. Even if you remove/reinsert the fuse, the BMS still sees that one cell out of range and won’t close contactors until all 12 cells in Circuit 5 are back within limits at rest (\~2.0 V+ for undervolt, \~4.1 V–4.2 V for overvolt).
   * The correct “soft” reset is to shut the car off (Ignition OFF) for 2–3 minutes. During that idle period, the weak cell may rebound a few hundred millivolts at rest. If it climbs back above the minimum, the BMS will re-close contactors and allow EV mode & regen again. If it doesn’t, the fault will immediately reappear.
4. **How to Truly Fix It: Rebalance or Replace**
   * **First**, do a full BMS rebalance cycle:
      * Charge to 100 % (AC if possible), leave the car OFF for 30–60 minutes so the BMS top‐balances the cells, then drive down to \~20 % SOC (so it can bottom‐balance).
      * After this, check in ISTA Live Data that all 12 cells in Circuit 5 are within ±0.02–0.05 V of each other. If they’re aligned, clear fault memory, let the BMS sleep, and confirm no 21F126/21F137 returns.
   * **If rebalance does not bring that cell back into range**, the most likely cause is hardware: either the **Cell Supervision Board (CSB) for Circuit 5 is faulty** (mis‐reading voltages) or one (or more) of the 12 cells in that module has a high internal resistance and collapses under load.
      1. **Reseat or swap the CSB connector first** (sometimes a loose ribbon cable pin can report a false reading).
      2. If the same cell still reads \~1.6 V (or stays above \~4.2 V on charge), you must either **replace the entire 12‐cell module** with a remanufactured/refurbished module or **send that module out for cell‐level rebuilding**, where bad cells are replaced and busbars re‐welded.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **“Electric Drive Restricted”** and **“Drivetrain Error”** during regen or acceleration happen because the BMS detected a cell out of safe voltage range on Circuit 5 and has forcibly opened the HV contactors—so neither drive nor regen can occur until the pack is safe again.
* Regenerative braking can’t raise the voltage of a cell once the BMS has already decoupled it; the BMS always isolates first, then only allows reconnection when all cells are back in a safe window at rest.
* The permanent fix is to **get Circuit 5 back into balance** (or replace the faulty hardware)",2025-05-31 15:48:59,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BMW/comments/1kzxjoo/bmw_330e_hybrid_problem/,"BMW 330e hybrid problem **Problem Overview:**

bmw,Original Parts,"Hello,  
I recently bought a 2023 BMW 530e, which is currently being shipped to my country. While I wait for it to arrive, I’d like to purchase some essential maintenance parts in advance — specifically the oil filter, air filter, and possibly the cabin air filter.  
The car has 36,647 km on it and is a U.S. import. I noticed that the cabin air filter was last replaced at 29,916 km, so I’m wondering if it’s necessary to replace it again already. I’ve noticed that the cabin filter is relatively expensive, which makes me hesitant unless it’s actually due for a change.  
As for buying parts, I’ve heard good things about FCP Euro, especially regarding their sale of OEM parts. I’ve never ordered from them before, but many say they’re reliable. I saw that they list Mahle as the manufacturer for the oil filter. Is Mahle considered OE for the 2023 BMW 530e?

Volkswagen,AXU engine trouble,"Hi, I'm hoping someone can help me with my 05 polo 1.4FSI, as it seems really hard to find any info about the AXU engine. So, a few weeks ago, the engine started shaking and being low on power. Felt like running on 3 cylinder, but still driveable. Immediately stopped using it, and my OBDII scanner (chepa universal device) said cylinder 4 misfire. Changed spark plugs, coils without improvement. So I recently got a replacement injector, and installed it yesterday. It was terrible, terrible overall.I do have the VW workshop manual, which gives absolutely no useful information about how to do anything related to removing the intake manifold. The manifold is 2 pieces, and the large plastic manifold is simply too large to take out, because the high pressure fuel pump is in the way... Anyway, I managed to access the injectors, and change injector number 4. The car now runs incredible rough. What was a shaky idle is now not running without flooring it. I'm a bit lost.
Scanner now says ""cylinder 4 misfire"" and ""fuel pressure regulator low""

Note:
- I didn't test the resistance value of the injectors (which I now realize VW gave nominal value)
- The injector is not the exact one needed for my car, per all parts shops. A company reconditioning injectors advised me to use ""03C906036A"" instead of ""036906036"" because it can't be found anywhere anymore.
- The intake manifold is coated with a 2mm layer of oily carbon deposit, which I expected due to EGR, and being a CRDI.
- The car has 110 000km (70 000mi) and is in an overall good shape, so I would like to keep it.

What should be my next steps ?
- Get VCDS to a proper diagnostic tool ?
- Put everything back in place with the old injector and see if it runs like it did or not ? (which could indicate if I messed a wire or something else)
- I've read somewhere that CRDIs need recoded after new injectors ? Workshop manual doesn't talk about it.

Is there any way of making the job easier than working with the manifold loose but still in the engine bay ?

Volkswagen,"Brakes dragging post replacement, how much is normal?","Hello all, I've just been replacing all the pads and rotors on my Golf MK4 2.0L, I've noticed some drag on the brakes and I'm hoping to understand a little better. How much drag is normal?  
I've checked the hoses through diagnostic tests and it seems like they're okay, if any of you have any unique diagnostic tests please let me know. I have bled the brakes as well just to be certain. I also noticed that the handbrake is against the mechanical stopper, leading me to believe that is not the issue. Nonetheless there is audible brake drag and I don't believe that is normal but I couldn't find anything online for what normal is. If any of you have a video of what they should look and sound like after a replacement that would be very helpful.  
I've also looked at the pistons moving as the brake pedal is pushed and noticed it does not retract as much as it will protract for each push of the pedal. I have yet to check the brake booster but I read that is possibly a cause of drag.

Volkswagen,"Maps help, with first car.","Hello,
Got my first car this weekend. It's a VW Golf, 2014, a Jap import and I'm based in Ireland.

I'm hoping someone can advise me on how to get the maps to work on the car?

Nothing happens when I press the navigation button.

I've done a good bit of googling now, and can't find out what I'm doing wrong.

Here's a few points about the car and what I've tried

•Car is a Jap import, bought from local dealership 
•VW Golf TSI Mark 7 2014
•I've checked the website for instructions on downloading maps, picked out my car, downloaded my region onto SD card, unzipped file, inserted in SD card slot, started car, nothing happens. I can check the SD card and see the files are there, so the car is able to recognise/read it. 
Nothing new happens when I press the navigation button.
I hold down the Menu button for 5 seconds, and the screen enters 'service mode', I click 'software download/versions', click 'update' then 'sd card', and it says 'reading release info' then says no files are suited.

I tried reformatting my SD card aswell, it's not an official VW one, but they say it doesn't need to be. 
I get mixed results when I ask which SD card is the right one.


I restored it to factory settings a couple times, and the language is in English.

Hope someone could help me out, of course I could just use Google maps, and it'd probably be better, but just cause this is my new car, and first car, I'd like to have that feature working, it'd just feel good!

Volkswagen,Passat 2011 2.0tdi Spare wheel problem,"Hi

I have accidentally found out that somehow I have water in the trunk, where the spare wheel is. I tried taking the wheel out but can't move the locking mechanism even an inch. Is there some sort of trick to it?  
The black thing in the middle won't move, but I've managed to open the little round thing in the middle of the locking mechanism, but haven't found anything in there (second pic)... Was thinking it might have gotten stuck because nobody used it for a long time but I don't have wrench wide enough to try and it also is plastic so it would likely break. Any ideas?

Volkswagen,Strange rubbing noise MK7.5 Golf GTE,"Hi everyone,

I’ve ran into a weird problem with my Golf GTE from 2018.
About 6 months ago i accidentally hit a curb with my FL wheel with about 60 km/h.
Wheel and tire were trashed, but i had these fixed (two new front tires to keep it symmetrical).
About a month after, i started hearing this strange rubbing noise (video).
I assumed it was because of the curb, so i replaced my FL wheel bearing and driveshaft, noise still there..

Now there are some important things to note here:

- Noise starts at about 60 km/h and remains when going faster.
- It seems to be coming front the front left side.
- The frequency increases as i go faster.
- Below 60 km/h it disappears.
- It sounds like a rotational out of balance noise, if that somewhat explains it.
- Steering slightly to the left (about 45 degrees on the steering wheel) makes it louder.
- Steering the same amount to the right makes it almost fully disappear.
- I switched to winter wheels and the noise remains, so the wheels/tires are not the culprit.
- After the wheel was fixed, i also had the car aligned (no strange findings were reported).
- I bought the car with 23.000 km on the odo.
- The accident happened at about 48.000 km.
- I know of a Golf GTD owner who has had the exact same accident en now has the exact same noise. This could somewhat rule out the engine, gearbox or differential since they are totally different (he has not found the cause yet).

Because steering has an effect on the noise, i think it might be my FR wheel bearing, but that doesn’t add up, because i hit my FL wheel.
I assumed that this noise is the logical effect of me hitting the curb, but at this point i am not sure anymore.

I have taken the car to 3 different mechanics and all three have no clue.

Volkswagen,Jetta 2017 headlight moisture – where are the vents located?,"Hi all,
I have a 2017 Jetta (EU model) and noticed moisture buildup inside the front right headlight (OE Bi-xenon) I removed the rear cover and left the car in direct sunlight for 4 hours — about 90% of the moisture disappeared, which helped a lot.

Now I’m trying to locate the headlight vents or breather holes to check if they’re clogged or blocked. I’ve looked around the housing but I’m not sure exactly where they are.

I’m attaching a few photos — if anyone can point out where the vent(s) are located or what I should be looking for, I’d really appreciate the help!

Volkswagen,2.0l TSI timing chain replacement: that annoying turbo muffler/elbow gasket,"I replaced the timing chain on my 2010 CC (was 6.57 degrees out plus had the original tensioner).  All went well (timing is good) except that I unscrewed the turbo outlet muffler/elbow to help access the lower timing cover and I can not get its fine o-ring back in place.  I screwed it back together with the o-ring misplaced, but now I'm pretty sure this has caused a vacuum leak (but it could also be the lower timing cover, not sure..).  I'm about to delete the o-ring and replace it with RTV black, but wonder if anyone has any better suggestions?

I found a video where the technician doesn't remove it to get the lower cover off- instead he fully removed the serpentine belt tensioner pulley assembly.  I highly recommend you go this route (you need a super long socket extension to reach it from the other side of the engine, but whatever).  You might has well replace this tensioner since you are taking it off..

\[One other hint for anybody else attempting this: there is an M6 torx screw and thick washer fastening the exhaust cam bridge to the exhaust cam shaft.  The shaft threads on mine were partially stripped: the hint is that you really need to replace this screw.  The FCP Euro M6 screw kit for the lower timing cover comes with 16 screws pre-coated with Loctite blue.  Use one of these.\]

Volkswagen,07k Swapping a 1 of 24 Mk1 Rabbit,"I spent last weekend swapping a 07k 5 cylinder into my friend’s mk1 rabbit. This was a 1 of 24 electric rabbit produced for the Michigan electric company DTE in 1981 and is the last one know to exist.

Volkswagen,Volkswagen Golf MK7 TSI Transmission Overheating/Failure?,"Hey gang!

Currently writing this as I'm waiting for a lift. Was driving on the highway and suddenly felt like my automatic transmission shifted down to the 4-5 gear going up the hill but felt stuck there. Maybe a loss of power/overheating? 

But I stopped off the highway maybe 3km later and had a Transmission Overheating message. Later waited an hour to cool down and drive again but the car can barely get to speed, transmission feels clunky and can't drive.

Will have it towed tomorrow, but it's a 2015 base Golf with 156 000 kms, is it worth to get an opinion at a specialist garage? Is my transmission cooked?

Volkswagen,Gear indicator not lighting up,"Hey, I just replaced my gear shifter knob for the newer model (bought it from AliExpress). For some reason, when I use the splitter cable that should light up both of them (the knob and the original indicator lights), the lights flicker at startup and then nothing.

I'm getting confused because once or twice when I was assembling everything back, the lights worked. But had no luck when I closed everything and tried turning off and on again.

If I use the original wire connected to the original indicator lights, it works flawlessly.

Volkswagen,Volkswagen MK8 Golf Badge Stolen,"Hi all,

Title says it all, my Volkswagen badge and radar were stolen the other day, along with another three cars on my street, on the same day.

I’ve just had it replaced at a local garage who charged a fraction of the cost, but there’s nothing stopping it from happening again.

Any ideas on how to make the process far more difficult / noisier, or even near impossible? 

Otherwise I have no choice but to sell the car. ( In the event it happens again )

Volkswagen,B8 Passat Alltrack TDI stalling on take off - help needed,"My 2017 Passat Alltrack (2.0 TDI, 6 speed DSG) has a recurring issue where it will stall when releasing the brake and taking off from a stand-still. It only happens when the car is cold. All shifts and behaviours of the gearbox are normal otherwise, but this presents a big issue - especially when stopped at a set of traffic lights! The issue happens with auto stop start disabled (I have it permanently disabled via a switch under the button, but the malfunction has been present from before I installed this).

All servicing is up to date and the car has 125,000kms. At its last service, the mechanic (Euro car specialist, but not a VW dealer) advised it was showing the codes P072C, P072B, P174A and P179D and they believed the issue was with the mechatronic unit, and that replacement would be in the vicinity of $4-6k (ouch).

I am wondering if anyone else has seen or dealt with this issue, and if there is anything else more simple it could be? (eg MAP sensor, idle control, fuelling issue when cold etc).

Volkswagen,"missed deadlines, surprise repairs, and a buyback win","Just wanted to share an update on my CAMVAP arbitration journey with my 2023 Volkswagen ID.4. After dealing with a persistent brake pedal squeak for 18 months (and several failed attempts to fix it), I had my second CAMVAP hearing on April 21, 2025.

Here’s the short version of what happened:

After I won my first CAMVAP hearing in January 2025, VW was ordered to repair the issue within 30 business days. That didn’t happen. I had a scheduled appointment on February 25, confirmed in advance, but they didn’t actually perform the repair. They told me that the parts were there and that the repair would be completed, but the parts were not there and they did NOT complete the repair. It was in the shop for 2 weeks though. Why? Who knows…

On April 1, I got two emails—one from CAMVAP confirming the April 21 hearing date, and one from the dealership saying the part (brake booster) was finally available and they were ready to schedule the repair for April 17. Suspicious timing, right?

The best part? I found out during the April 21 hearing, from the manufacturer’s expert, that the brake booster had already been replaced. This was the first I’d heard of it. My response was:  
**“If my vehicle is fixed, why isn’t it in my driveway?”**

Just so you know, April 21 is Easter Monday and the Friday before was Good Friday (both statutory holidays in British Columbia). So that would have left the weekend only to perform the repair… also suspicious, right?

In the end, the arbitrator awarded me a buyback, acknowledging the unlikelihood that the vehicle had actually been repaired properly this time and that the back and forth must end. This journey took nearly two years and countless hours of follow-up, paperwork, and wasted time.

Here's a list of some of the issues we experienced with our ID.4:

* Persistent brake pedal squeak (subject of two CAMVAP hearings because this was deemed to be the ONLY ISSUE eligible for arbitration)

* Infotainment screen flickering and blacking out

* Headlights stopped working in the cold weather

* Erratic window behavior (windows going down instead of up)

* Rear passenger overhead light flickering (on and off by itself while driving)

* Air conditioning failure during summer vacation in Penticton, BC (heat wave, parts backordered for 2 months)

* Unreliable door handles, including one that popped open while reversing and trapping my son in the backseat. I couldn’t access him! I couldn’t get him out of the car if we were in an accident… this was still not eligible for arbitration because there was an active recall on the door handles.

* Multiple outstanding software-related problems

* Recall fixes delayed—many labeled “pending” with no completion timeline

After dealing with a persistent brake pedal squeak for 18 months (and several failed attempts to fix it), I had my second CAMVAP hearing on April 21, 2025.

Here’s the short version of what happened:

After I won my first CAMVAP hearing in January 2025, VW was ordered to repair the issue within 30 business days. That didn’t happen. I had a scheduled appointment on February 25, confirmed in advance, but they didn’t actually perform the repair. They told me that the parts were there and that the repair would be completed, but the parts were not there and they did NOT complete the repair. It was in the shop for 2 weeks though. Why? Who knows…

On April 1, I got two emails—one from CAMVAP confirming the April 21 hearing date, and one from the dealership saying the part (brake booster) was finally available and they were ready to schedule the repair for April 17. Suspicious timing, right?

Volkswagen,Likelihood of a subframe bolt becoming cross-threaded and breaking in half from normal wear and tear after being replaced 4 months ago.,"In January of this year, I went to a Midas for a wheel alignment. They came back and told me I needed to replace both front lower control arms and that the car was unsafe to drive. I approved the repairs, yet afterward, the wheel was still not aligned.

I went back in March to have the wheel aligned at another location and asked if they could also determine what was causing a rattling noise when I drove the car. They said they aligned the wheel but could not identify the rattling noise. The wheel was still not aligned, so I went back to the original shop and asked them to align the wheel, since it was within the 90-day warranty period. They ""aligned the wheel,"" and again it wasn't aligned. At that point, I gave up.

Now it's May, and the car started jerking left and right. I took it to a VW dealership for an oil change and to determine what was wrong with the car. The VM mechanic determined that one of the lower control arm bolts was cross-threaded and had broken. Causing damage to the transmission oil pan because the bolt was rubbing against the pan, and that the subframe and control arm now need to be replaced again.

I contacted the Midas shop to ask them to cover the cost of the new repair, but they refused unless I brought the car back to them. I don't feel comfortable bringing the car back after they installed the parts improperly the first time. They also claim that these things happen; the bolt could have broken from hitting a bump in the road, and if it were installed improperly, I would have seen an issue sooner.

Volkswagen,Was the base speaker system improved sometime in the last few years?

Volkswagen,What spoiler is best for the VW EOS?,"I got my first car a month ago as a gift for graduating high school. It was a used 2010 VW EOS. Me and my dad have been working on it since then adding things to it. I brought up to him the idea of putting on a spoiler (we both like spoilers, very cool looking lol), but couldn't decide what spoiler looked best. He wanted to put a lip spoiler on it, but I didn't want anything that touched so I informed him that I would rather put a low profile on or just a basic spoiler. He said he wasn't sure if it was the best idea to have that extra weight on the trunk lid especially since we like to go top down a lot. So I have come here to ask on opinions. What do you think would look best?

Volkswagen,VW e-Up – Which upgrades are actually worth it? (What I’ve done so far + future ideas),"Hey everyone,
I’m currently tweaking my dad’s VW e-Up. I wouldn’t say I love the car, but it’s solid — VW clearly left a lot of potential on the table, so I’m trying to improve a few things in terms of comfort, handling, and overall usability.

Here’s what I’ve done so far:
	•	Swapped headlights and interior lighting for LEDs
	•	Installed rear mud flaps (the car gets insanely dirty without them)
	•	Added an engine bay seal (VW removed it around 2018 – this helps keep dirt and water out)
	•	Replaced the cabin air filter with a HEPA filter

Things I’m considering next:
	•	Adding the underbody shield from the Cross-Up (should help reduce dirt in the engine bay and possibly improve aerodynamics/range)
	•	Lowering the suspension and installing stiffer dampers — the stock setup is way too soft for our taste (our other cars are a GR Yaris and a Volvo 850 T5-R, both much firmer)
	•	Upgrading both summer and winter tires — the stock ones offer poor grip and the car understeers easily, especially when I’m driving (and I can’t turn of the damn traction control or reduce it and for me it’s like a nanny who allows little fun)
	•	Infotainment upgrade? The stock phone holder is honestly just annoying. Has anyone added a proper standalone infotainment display? Is it worth it? Any recommendations?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s done meaningful upgrades to their e-Up, Mii electric, or Citigo-e. What worked well? What wasn’t worth it?

Volkswagen,Brake and steering feel?,"Question purely out of curiosity! My car is a 2022 Golf. I drove a new model T-Cross today with 500km on the odometer as a loaner. I thought it would be a similar feel because VW but… hell no! Totally different. 

The brakes were way “softer” - much stronger/sharper with very little pressure but then at the same time super squishy. Like memory foam?! So hard to explain. Like I’d put my foot on the pedal and it was like the brakes themselves have some dampening or softening effect on them to make the pedal’s effect more gradual instead of direct, if that makes any sense. It was really bizarre. 

Then the steering itself had basically no weight in it. Made me realise how weighted the Golf steering is (which I like much more than nothing). Also the suspension was much rougher. I get it, it’s an SUV so obviously different but I just thought it’d be a bit more similar than it was 😂 

So my question is… what creates these different feels? Why were the brakes so squishy? Why steering so light? I appreciate my little Golf even more now! I feel like when I drive it, everything is just there. It’s direct, comfy, natural/intuitive, balanced.

byd,"BYD Sealion 5 (Song Pro) Owner – 2 Months, 2000 km Review & Questions","Hello BYD Owners  
I’ve had the BYD Sealion 5 (known as Song Pro in some markets) for about two months now, here in Cambodia. I’ve already put over 2000 km on it, mostly commuting to and from work (a total of 11 km both ways). Overall, I’m really enjoying the car and have saved a lot on gas since I rarely use the gas engine—most of my driving is on electric power.

However, I have a couple of concerns and would like to know if anyone else is experiencing the same issues:

**1. Undercarriage Openings and Wildlife Problems**  
I’ve noticed that there are several holes, gaps, or openings under the car. I assume these were part of the design for airflow or some other reason, but the problem is that animals (rodents, frogs, etc.) seem to be able to get inside. For example, I once found a dead frog stuck inside the area under the car's engine, which led to a terrible smell. I’ve also seen what appears to be rat or mouse droppings in the front engine compartment.  
**Has anyone else experienced issues with wildlife entering their Sealion 5 or Song Pro due to these undercarriage openings? How do you deal with it?**

**2. Electric Range Degradation**  
When I first got the car, the gauge showed about 71 km of electric range on a full charge. After about 1700 km of driving, I’m now only seeing 65–66 km of range on a full charge. I feel like I never actually got the full 71 km in real-world use or the now 65 km range, but I’m still concerned about how quickly the range appears to be dropping.   
**Is anyone else noticing a similar drop in electric range after a couple of months? Is this normal, or should I be worried about battery health?**

Thanks in advance for any advice or shared experiences!",2025-06-02 11:05:44,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BYD/comments/1l1d9pb/byd_sealion_5_song_pro_owner_2_months_2000_km/,"BYD Sealion 5 (Song Pro) Owner – 2 Months, 2000 km Review & Questions Hello BYD Owners

byd,Local seller is importing BYD cars straight from China,"Hey all,

I noticed that on one of our cars sites in my country that a new company opened Jan 2025 is selling BYD models that are brand new. Its quite obvious that the cars imported are made for the Chinese market.

Now the seller does mention 5 years warranty or 150 000km whatever comes first also battery warranty and that they offer parts and repairs. However this is not BYD dearlship (they dont have a official dealership in my country maybe 2026/2027) and not like they have an established history on the market selling other models.

My worry is that the seller may simply vanish and that if BYD do open a official dealership and service if I roll in with a car imported from China they will refuse service (I am in the EU). Am i being justifiedly cautious. Or would my warranty with this seller just be handled by the official dealership if they close up.",2025-06-01 12:14:53,4,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BYD/comments/1l0lji4/local_seller_is_importing_byd_cars_straight_from/,"Local seller is importing BYD cars straight from China Hey all,

byd,Problems charging at home,"I bought a BYD Song Pro GL last month here in São Paulo/Brazil, but can’t manage to charge at home.
 I didn’t have a 220v outlet close to the car, so hired an electrician to make the adaptation.

Hired the electrician a second time and he grounded the specific outlet, but still doesn’t work. 

The portable charger keeps blinking “power” and “fault” lights, as if there was an issue with the grounding. The electrician made multiple test and they showed the grounding is fine.

Charger is a Jonhon EV Mode 2. Current voltage at the outlet is ~237V.

byd,AC performance after update V1.8.2,"Just got the latest update for our Atto here in Finland, and noticed a change in the AC Auto mode.

Only after setting it to manual and to LO temp the cold air started flowing, making the Auto mode pretty much useless now.

Well they don’t. It seems like is a byd custom made part and has to be bought in house.

Now I have been waiting for over a week when they told me it would only take a couple of days and it has been very rainy lately in England, so I need it asap as I drive around the country for work.

byd,BYD Tang EV - Annoying things,"Hi Guys, 

Got my Byd Tang delivered i Denmark 3 weeks ago and i have stumbled upon a few pretty annoying things. Maybe it is just like that or maybe there is a work around or maybe im just dumb 🤣

1: ICC
It works ok, but any way to override the 120 km/h max ? Speed limit is 130 km/h many places so it is kinda annoying. It a nice help to have on long drives. 

2: ACC
The sensitivity of ACC is crazy. It is set to shortest distance but it starts slowing down really early. And on top of that it speeds up pretty slowly when road is clear. And that is in sport mode. If in normal it is even worse and in ECO you can barely use it. 

3: 360deg cam and park assistance
When starting car and driving it does not turn off again. Also when doing a turn and it turns on it often does not turn off again. And then when you are driving slow into yoir garage for instance it does not turn on. The cam itself is pretty awesome but the turning on/off is really random. I know there is a button the steering wheel to quickly turn on/off. 

4: Apple Carplay
Often my apple carplay have black screen when it connects. And when i turn it off on phone it take a shit ton of time for the car to stop trying to reconnect. 

5: Night driving
Driving at night there is a lot of light. Even if dimming is on auto so it should dim all displays it does not dim them fully. And the reading lights in the ceiling has a light stripe around that is not dimming at all. So when im driving at night it is 3 different menues to get everything in order and then the next reverse it. 

6: Remote key
Often when i unlock car with key it will only unlocke driver door. 

7: Apple carplay
Anyway to get a bit more volume out of it when listening to spotify. It is not loud enough.

8: Driver monitoring
Had to put tape on the driver monitoring. It is simply insane and making noise all the time. Guess there is no way around other than navigating through menues each time you start. 

9: Kick sensor for opening boot is only opening 30%. Something disrupts it and engages the safety. 

It is all minor things, but if some of them can solved by settings or doing thing correct might as well check 😀

Otherwise awesome car, really love it.

byd,BYD discount coming to Australia?,"Hi All,
I recently put a $1000 fully refundable deposit on a BYD Sealion 7. I have some small concerns but not really about the make and model of car.

Recently a few things have happened…

BYD has heavily discounted their vehicles in China. Which we don’t know if this will flow to Australia.

Also very recently they have cut out EV direct who were the main distributor in Australia and now will sell directly from BYD.

It would be super annoying to buy one at full price and then see this car drop substantially as I already believe like most EVs we are going to suffer badly for resell.

Lastly does anyone think the new blade 2 battery will be coming to these models shortly, potentially making the kilometer range higher?",2025-05-30 15:18:57,9,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BYD/comments/1kz40t9/byd_discount_coming_to_australia/,"BYD discount coming to Australia? Hi All,

byd,Test drive turned into instant purchase.,"So my wife and I went for a test drive yesterday here in Japan(yes,we live and work here) and we are scheduled to test drive the sealion 7 and the atto 3. We were really impressed by the looks and specs of them on their website and had to see them in person for ourselves. So we arrived and an agent greeted us with warm welcome and drinks. While the agent prepped our test drive vehicles,my wife decided to test drive only the ATTO 3 coz the Sealion's size is just too big to drive around our neighborhood. 

My wife drove the car coz she's the driver in our family. She said the it drives like a dream! And yes it is way smoother than out Toyota Raize.The touch screen panel is HUGE! It's a big upgrade! The seat feels amazing and the interior is just out of this world! It really is different when you are looking at it in person. And then I had to try the voice command by opening the sun roof and it just blew our brains out! These features are premium options when you add it as options in other car brands. Not to mention all the other stuff it has and how affordable the car is! This dealership also offered to buy our car, I said how much the estimate is (of course i lied). The agent checked the car of how much the appraisal value really is and they said yes to the amount i said(way higher compared to our Toyota dealership). SOOO we decided that it's time to replace our car.

We did all the paperwork, additional options like drive recorders and ETC, signing and loan applications. It took about 2 hours. And then we were like ""Well maybe it will take them 2-3 months for the delivery of the car BUT NO, the agent said that they will deliver the car in 3 WEEKS!!! SO yeah, that was our experience with BYD dealership(Shinagawa branch) and everything went smoothly,we are just so excited to drive our new EV ATTO 3 and we are happy to say goodbye to petroleum.

Also committing to a lower cost model feels better since BYD tech is changing rapidly, so Sealion might be outdated before we know it too. Any inputs?

byd,How media playback works is broken,"I have a BYD SL6 (though I think this applies to a few models). And I think if you have two or more members of your household that use the car with Android Auto or Apple CarPlay (or to a lesser but significant extent use ""the radio') you get a really poor experience to the point where I consider it a 'death by a thousand cuts' 

Let's look at a few of these cuts:

* BT will always pair to the last paired device
* Device determines playback setting on car startup (no override in the car)
* There is no way to disconnect a device without access to it (it will keep reconnecting)
* There is no physical pause button 
* When reversing volume,mute, and voice control buttons are disabled 
* In fact all buttons other than camera controls are disabled on the touch screen  (including aircon gesture controls) - even though about 20% of the display is showing these unusable buttons
* Even though everything is disabled like ""you better concentrate on reversing"" if a call comes in to the paired device it will  cover up a random quarter of the screen 
* The screen rotate button can no longer be customized (at least not on SL6)

So you wake up in the morning and start reversing the car, someone else's music/audiobook/call is playing, you press every button you can see to get it to stop, only to realize that the only way to stop it is to take the car out of reverse, ensure you have your own device on you (or disable Bluetooth entirely until you are out of range) go through about 3 menus, pair it to your device, wait for it to initiate its default playback behavior - pause playback via the display and then continue reversing.

My wife and I reflected (and we were both really surprised by this) that despite the fact that in almost every other way we think this car is amazing - it ruins the morning just enough that neither of us would want a BYD again and that we miss our old car and it's incredible ""pause playback physical button"" technology.


Byd could fix this problem as easily as not disabling mute or better still also make the mute button pause or mute depending on Mode like almost all other modern cars so.

I have noticed that at least some of these issues go back to the Seal and I really hope they look into it and update this.

byd,BYD Seal vs Sealion 7 – dream vs reality after misunderstanding salary sacrifice cost,"Hey all,

I could really use some honest opinions on this. I'm looking at getting a car through a salary sacrifice scheme (Octopus EV), and I thought I had a good handle on the costs… until I realised the quoted prices were after-tax take-home pay, not pre-tax. That was a bit of a shock.

Originally, I was looking at more budget-friendly EVs like the Skoda Elroq or Omoda E5, but then I test drove the BYD Seal and Sealion 7, and they both absolutely blew me away.

The Sealion 7 is a fantastic family SUV – loads of space, packed with features, comfy as hell, and still looks pretty sharp. Felt like a proper flagship EV.

But then I drove the Seal (fast one), and… wow. It just felt refined, luxurious, and fun. Like, I walked away thinking, “this is the nicest car I’ve ever sat in.” It’s not an SUV, but it still has a decent boot, and honestly it gave me that special feeling that’s hard to quantify.

Problem is:

Seal is about £466/month take-home

Sealion is around £510/month take-home


I'm on a decent salary, but we’re a one-child family already saving up hard for a house in 5–6 years, and I don’t want a car to mess that up. We also already have a smaller second car. Mileage will be around 5k/year.

The Sealion kind of made more sense at first, but now even the Seal feels like a financial stretch. I keep trying to justify it – like, is it better to love what I drive every day even if it costs a bit more? Or is this how people end up broke?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s driven both, or has been through this kind of  budget crisis. Is it worth stretching for something you love, or do I need to come back down to Earth?

Appreciate any advice.

My second gripe is my bonnet won't close or open properly I should say. What happens is I pull the latch once I see the bonnet pop I've pulled it a second time and nothing Really Happens so I get out to check the bonnet and I can't open it I must always return to the driver's seat pull the latch a third and fourth time and then I can get out go to the bonnet and open it. What's really annoying is I've taken it to two different by-d centers and both of them acknowledge after a test drive that the seat clicks and doesn't feel right but then they're not sure what to do about it? And then the bonnet they tell me it's not an issue because their tech tried it out and it worked but they never are able to make it work in front of me.

byd,BYD dealership discounts,"I bought my BYD Seal Performance almost a year ago and wanted to share my experience for the benefit of potential buyers.

At the time, I asked if there were any discounts, free service packages, or tinting offers. I was told that no discounts were available because BYD had thin profit margins, unlike other car brands.

So I went ahead and paid 194,900 SAR (~$51,970 USD) in cash — this price included 15% VAT.

But just a few days after my delivery, they started offering:
	•	Free 3-year service package

Then a couple of months later:
	•	20,000 SAR (~$5,330 USD) discount

And now, about 10 months after my purchase, they’re offering:
	•	A massive 45,000 SAR (~$12,000 USD) discount, bringing the cash price down to 149,900 SAR (~$39,970 USD).

I really like the car, but if you’re thinking of buying a BYD — you may want to wait for a promotion or at least try negotiating harder than I did.

Hope this helps someone make a better-timed decision than I did.",2025-05-20 14:59:34,11,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BYD/comments/1kr48rw/byd_dealership_discounts/,"BYD dealership discounts I bought my BYD Seal Performance almost a year ago and wanted to share my experience for the benefit of potential buyers.

byd,BYD Sealion 7 - first impression,"Yesterday I picked up my BYD Sealion 7 (Excellent AWD) in Poland, and my first impressions are very positive.

I drove it 220 km from the dealership (Delarea) to my home, mostly on fast express roads with a speed limit of 120 km/h. I maintained a speed of around 120 km/h, give or take 10 km/h. The battery was at 100% when I left the dealership and was at 50% upon arrival. Average energy consumption over the 220 km trip was 21 kWh/100 km. The outside temperature was 13°C, and the weather was dry.

For a car of this weight and with 20"" wheels, I must say — the efficiency is quite reasonable.

I'm currently running software version 1.2.1.

The build quality feels premium, the ride comfort is excellent, and cabin sound insulation is outstanding.

And I speak from experience — this is my second EV. I've also owned a Toyota bZ4X since 2023, and the difference is night and day. The BYD is in a completely different league.

byd,Thinking of getting a BYD Sealion 7 – would love to hear from owners!,"
Hey folks,

I'm seriously considering the BYD Sealion 7 Comfort as my first EV and would love to hear some real-world experiences from current owners.

A bit about me – I’ve got a young family (one small child), and this car would mostly be used for weekend trips, family visits, and the occasional longer drive. My priorities are ride comfort, rear seat space for adults, and enough boot room for baby gear. I had a short test drive and was impressed with the ride and interior feel, but it's hard to tell much from 20 minutes behind the wheel.
I live in the UK and will purchase it through salary sacrifice scheme.

This would be my first EV, so I’m also curious about how it’s been living with the Sealion day-to-day – charging speed, real-world range, software, and any quirks worth knowing.

Would really appreciate any honest feedback – good or bad. Especially interested in how it handles longer drives with family onboard.

Thanks in advance!

byd,Cracking Noise from BYD Atto 3 Trunk Area – Help Needed!,"Hey fellow Atto 3 owners,

I’ve started hearing a cracking or cranking noise coming from the trunk door area after hitting around 1,000 km on the odometer. The sound is noticeable especially when driving over potholes or during sharp turns.

To investigate, I sat in the back seat while my wife drove, and I was able to pinpoint the noise to the interior plastic trim of the trunk. It doesn’t seem to be related to the usual flimsy sounds from the protective plastic covers, as I still have some of those on the rear seats, but this noise is different and more concerning.

Has anyone else experienced this?

Any tips, DIY solutions, or experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Please view the video below. It was taken at night but you can hear the crunking loud noise coming from the inside the interior trunk door.

byd,Side mirror acting weird (BYD Seal),"Hey guys,

My 2025 Seal AWD acted a bit weird a couple of times when I was adjusting the right side mirror. When I tapped the adjustment button very briefly, the mirror kept moving even after I released it, ending up completely misaligned. Normally, it should move just slightly, in proportion to the press. After some presses it got back to normal and I could finish adjusting.

It only happened twice, both times right after parking the car in the garage and putting it in P (not R).

I’ve adjusted the mirrors while stopped at traffic lights in D, and everything worked perfectly.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Could it be a setting or maybe a software glitch?",2025-05-16 14:25:27,3,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BYD/comments/1knzj7p/side_mirror_acting_weird_byd_seal/,"Side mirror acting weird (BYD Seal) Hey guys,

byd,BYD Seal VTOL (V2L) port lock glitch - Workaround found.,"Hi Everyone,

Just a quick FYI I found with my BYD Seal today.

I was testing out the V2L adapter, very simple, just ran a hairdryer on it for 10min to make sure all was functional. I turned off the dryer, and then turned off the V2L adapter.

I pressed the unlock on the FOB, but I found I could not disconnect the adapter.

I tried the double press, same.

I jumped in the car and tried to turn on, but the message in the screen said the VTOL was still engaged and was making all the visuals of still discharging. So refused to do anything, not even turn the wheel.

I got out and turned off the car and locked it... thought it might just need some time to realise I had stopped drawing power.  20min later, no luck, charging port was still locked with the same VTOL message.

I called the BYD tech support and when I finally got though, they said to do a factory reset, and if the same after, come into a service center..  I said fine to the factory reset, but car will not start as adapter still connected and message has locked system... So cant drive anywhere.

Did factory reset, still the same, no different.

I was just about to call their roadside assist when I let the intrusive thoughts win.

I pressed the unlock button rapidly and repeatedly and to my shock, on the 6th repeated press (yes I was counting) of the unlock, the charging port disconnected (could hear the click).

Now, I could not find any reference of the same issue in the forums so far, so I thought I would throw in a FYI here.

If you are stuck with a V2L message on the dash after depowering and turning off the adapter, just spam the unlock button till it hopefully gets around the programming block and disconnects.",2025-05-16 07:07:45,16,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/BYD/comments/1knsw8k/byd_seal_vtol_v2l_port_lock_glitch_workaround/,"BYD Seal VTOL (V2L) port lock glitch - Workaround found.

byd,Help - Sealion 7 ACC Updates my speed limit automatically.,"Hi All,

Got Sealion 7, service in 3 weeks so i was going to wait for that but its getting annoying...

Didnt start until i went through a car wash (when i noticed it) but i may have hit some stupid setting with the res+/- combo.

  
Issue:

I set a speed on ACC, lets say 60.

Car drives at \~60.

I want to overtake/speed up, so i manually use the accelerator, get up to 68-69 to overtake/change lanes.

Once im off the accelerator (or even going that speed for a longer period) it then changes my ACC to whatever i had the higher speed at, so in this case 68-69.

Now my ACC is set to 68 and i have to use the switch down twice (65>60) to get back.

  
In the past (and how the manual explains it) it should STAY AT 60 unless i either use the switch

Single tap up for +5 or HOLD it for +1 increments.

  
Does anyone know what i may have enabled/changed/pressed for it to update my ACC Speed to the higher speed automatically.

  
Thanks!

byd,Flasks that fit in the Dolphin! (UK),"Hi all UK BYD owners!

Not sure if the problem exists in all the vehicles but certainly in my girlfriend's Dolphin she was struggling to fit two cups side by side.

At the weekend I found Tesco have a 420ml Hot/Cold flask that fits really well! Just wanted to share incase anybody hadn't found one yet 😁. Very cheap at only £8 and seems well made with a latch and lock mechanism.

After the app update I can't see battery information.
